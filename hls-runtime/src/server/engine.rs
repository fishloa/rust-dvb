//! [`HlsOrigin`] — the LL-HLS origin [`ServedEgress`] (plan step 4):
//! blocking-reload/part-availability *decision* logic and playlist rendering,
//! rendered directly from a shared [`Trunk`] instead of the deleted
//! `MediaStore` push-fed rolling window.
//!
//! Master/media playlist tags are RFC 8216 §4.3.4 (`#EXT-X-STREAM-INF`) and
//! §4.3.3 (`#EXTM3U`/`#EXT-X-VERSION`, rendered by [`MediaPlaylist::to_m3u8`]);
//! the blocking reload query parameters (`_HLS_msn`/`_HLS_part`) are the
//! Blocking Playlist Reload mechanism of RFC 8216bis §6.2.5.2 — the client
//! asks the origin to hold the response open until the requested Media
//! Sequence Number/part is available, bounded by the caller's own
//! [`AwaitPolicy`] so the origin never hangs indefinitely.
//!
//! # What comes straight from the `Trunk`, with no cache at all
//!
//! Every part-availability and blocking-reload decision reads the `Trunk`
//! directly, `&self`-shaped, every call:
//!
//! - **Live parts of the open segment** — [`Trunk::part_bytes`]/
//!   [`Trunk::parts_in_segment`] (step 3b-iv's live-part log). This is the
//!   whole reason step 3b-iv exists: before it, nothing in `Trunk` could
//!   answer "does part 3 of the segment currently being written exist",
//!   which is exactly what forced `MediaStore` to keep its own
//!   `live_parts`/`recent_parts` buffers in the first place.
//! - **Whether a segment has closed** — [`Trunk::last_closed_segment`].
//! - **The "in-progress-or-last-active segment" `MediaStore::latest_progress`
//!   used to track as a push-fed field** — [`HlsOrigin::live_edge`] derives
//!   it from the two queries above alone (`last_closed_segment() + 1`, probed
//!   via `parts_in_segment`), needing no field of its own. See that method's
//!   doc for the derivation and why it is exact, not a heuristic.
//! - **A just-closed segment's final part still resolving** — falls out of
//!   [`Trunk::part_bytes`] for free: [`media_plane::trunk::SegmentWriter::publish_segment`]
//!   deliberately never touches the live-part log (see `trunk`'s own module
//!   doc, "The live-part log"), so this crate no longer needs `MediaStore`'s
//!   separate `recent_parts` buffer at all — that buffer existed *only* to
//!   simulate exactly the guarantee the `Trunk` now gives natively.
//!
//! # The one thing that genuinely cannot come from the `Trunk` alone
//!
//! [`Trunk::subscribe_segments`] hands back a moving, single-consumer
//! [`SegmentCursor`] — there is no snapshot query over the segment log the
//! way [`Trunk::events_between`] gives the event log (see
//! `media_plane::egress`'s own module doc, "`ServedEgress::resolve` does not
//! take `&Trunk`", which anticipated exactly this). Rendering a Media
//! Playlist needs the **window** of currently-advertised closed segments
//! (their bytes, durations, and discontinuity bits), plus two numbers that
//! must survive eviction from that window: the lifetime-max segment
//! duration (RFC 8216bis §4.4.3.1's `TARGETDURATION` MUST) and the
//! cumulative discontinuity count that has rolled off the front
//! (`#EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY-SEQUENCE`, RFC 8216 §4.3.3.3). None of that is
//! answerable by a fresh `&self` call on `Trunk` — it has to be assembled by
//! draining a cursor over time.
//!
//! `Window` is that assembly, and it is **not** a second `MediaStore`: it
//! holds only bytes/duration/discontinuity-bit for the segments currently in
//! the advertised window, fed by exactly **one** [`SegmentCursor`] this
//! `HlsOrigin` owns — precisely the shape `media_plane::egress`'s module
//! doc prescribes ("a `ServedEgress` implementation... keeps its own
//! resolvable window in sync by draining [cursors]... `resolve` only ever
//! reads that already-synced state"). It carries none of `MediaStore`'s
//! other fields (`health`, `track_specs`, `created_at`, `window_segments()`
//! diagnostics) — those served `multimux`'s DASH/ll-DASH outputs, not
//! LL-HLS rendering, and are out of this step's scope (Step 5's problem, if
//! still needed once `multimux` is rewritten).
//!
//! The fMP4 **init segment** bytes are the other thing this module holds
//! outside the `Trunk`: an init segment is neither a sample, a finished
//! segment, an event, nor a live part — it is produced once by the
//! segmenter and never changes, so it was never in scope for any of
//! `Trunk`'s four rings. [`HlsOrigin::set_init`] is the (small, honest) side
//! channel for it — not a duplicate of anything `Trunk` holds.
