//! [`Trunk`] — the sample ring, [`TrunkWriter`], and [`SampleCursor`] (plan
//! step 3b-i); the segment log, [`SegmentCursor`], and the
//! lossless-by-retention pinning mechanism (plan step 3b-ii); the 90 kHz
//! event log, [`EventCursor`], and [`EventAnchor`] (plan step 3b-iii); the
//! live-part log and the [`Trunk::listen`] reader-wake primitive (plan step

//! and
//! [The reader-wake primitive](#the-reader-wake-primitive-listen-not-one-registration-per-remote-peer)
//! below; and now [`SegmentWriter`], splitting the single write handle 3b-i
//! introduced by **ring group** so a segmenter can exist at all — see
//! [One writer per ring group, not one writer per `Trunk`](#one-writer-per-ring-group-not-one-writer-per-trunk)
//! below — per
//! `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-26-media-plane-architecture.md` §1.2.
//!
//! This is four bounded rings behind two write handles, split by ring group
//! (see the section linked just above), and the cursors/queries that read
//! them: the sample path, the segment log, the event log, and the live-part
//! log. See
//! [The event log: 90 kHz absolute, and the B1 crux](#the-event-log-90-khz-absolute-and-the-b1-crux)
//! below for why the event log needed a third, genuinely different shape —
//! not just a third copy of `ClassLog`/`SegmentLog` (this module's internal
//! per-class/per-segment logs) — to resolve the architecture audit's
//! blocking finding B1.
//!
//! # One writer per ring group, not one writer per `Trunk`
//!
//! [`Trunk::writer`] used to be the *only* way to publish anything, and its
//! doc said so in terms broader than the actual reason it exists: "a second
//! concurrent writer would silently interleave two unrelated publish
//! sequences into one ring with no way for a reader to tell them apart." That
//! sentence is true, but it over-generalises from "one ring" to "one
//! `Trunk`" — and a real consumer wiring this crate up (a segmenter: it reads
//! samples via a [`SampleCursor`] and, from what it reads, produces segments
//! and parts) hit the gap that over-generalisation opened: with exactly one
//! writer for the entire `Trunk`, whichever component takes it for ingest
//! samples makes it **structurally impossible** for anything else to ever
//! call [`SegmentWriter::publish_segment`] — no segmenter can exist, and a
//! segment log/live-part log that can never be filled is not a real feature,
//! just an unreachable one.
//!
//! **The actual invariant, restated correctly**: *within a given ring, there
//! is exactly one appender* — that is what prevents the interleave the
//! original sentence worried about, because an interleave requires two
//! writers racing to append to the *same* ring. It says nothing about a
//! *different* ring. So the write capability is split by **ring group**,
//! each still taken at most once via the same `compare_exchange` pattern
//! [`Trunk::writer`] always used, just with one flag per group instead of
//! one flag for the whole `Trunk`:
//!
//! - [`TrunkWriter`] (via [`Trunk::writer`]) — the **samples + events**
//!   group: [`TrunkWriter::publish`] (the two [`RetentionClass`] sample
//!   rings) and [`TrunkWriter::publish_event`] (the event ring's only
//!   *appending* operation). Held by the ingest driver — the entity that
//!   actually produces both: a demuxed sample, or an inband SCTE-35/`emsg`
//!   event lifted straight off the incoming stream.
//! - [`SegmentWriter`] (via [`Trunk::segment_writer`]) — the
//!   **segments + parts** group: [`SegmentWriter::publish_segment`],
//!   [`SegmentWriter::publish_part`], plus
//!   [`SegmentWriter::note_segment_start`]/[`SegmentWriter::set_time_anchor`].
//!   Held by whoever owns segmentation.
//!
//! The last two methods are grouped here on purpose, not by accident of
//! naming: neither **appends** an entry to the event ring the way
//! [`TrunkWriter::publish_event`] does — both *resolve an already-stored*
//! [`EventAnchor::Segment`]/[`EventAnchor::Utc`] entry **in place** (see
//! [The event log](#the-event-log-90-khz-absolute-and-the-b1-crux) below).
//! Since neither is an append, giving them to [`SegmentWriter`] does not
//! create a second appender for the event ring — [`TrunkWriter::publish_event`]
//! remains the event ring's only one — while `note_segment_start` in
//! particular *has* to live wherever segmentation lives: only the segmenter
//! knows where a segment boundary actually falls (this is the literal B1 fix
//! — "it cannot be finalised until the segmenter owns a boundary"), so it is
//! the one entity that can honestly report `note_segment_start`. Placing
//! `set_time_anchor` alongside it, rather than on [`TrunkWriter`], keeps this
//! crate's set of "resolve a pending anchor" entry points in one place
//! instead of splitting a single conceptual capability (anchor resolution)
//! across two handles for no test or caller that needs it split further; if
//! a future caller's wall-clock mapping genuinely comes from the ingest side
//! instead, adding it to [`TrunkWriter`] alongside `publish_event` is
//! additive, not a breaking re-split of what is here today.
//!
//! **Still exactly one writer per group, enforced the same way**: both
//! [`Trunk::writer`] and [`Trunk::segment_writer`] return `None` on every
//! call after their first, via their own `AtomicBool` — two concurrent
//! *sample* writers remain exactly as impossible as before this split; what
//! changed is that a *segment* writer and a *sample* writer are no longer
//! forced to be the same handle.
//!
//! **The cross-ring ordering question this split raises, answered rather
//! than left implicit.** A segment is derived from samples the segmenter has
//! already consumed via its own [`SampleCursor`] — causally, those samples
//! exist first. With one shared writer, that causal fact was also a
//! *program-order* fact (one thread called `publish` some number of times,
//! then called `publish_segment`). With the split, ingest and segmentation
//! are ordinarily two different threads — could a consumer ever observe
//! [`SegmentWriter::publish_segment`]'s entry in the segment log *before* the
//! samples that produced it are visible in the sample ring? **No** — and not
//! by luck: every ring here (`timed`, `sparse`, `segments`, `events`,
//! `parts`) still lives inside the *one* `Mutex<TrunkState>` this module has
//! always used (see [the benchmark verdict](#the-benchmark-verdict-this-design-is-built-around)
//! below) — splitting the *write handle* did not split the *lock*. The
//! segmenter can only have samples to build a segment from because its own
//! `SampleCursor::poll` already returned them, which requires those samples
//! to have been committed to `state.timed`/`state.sparse` under an *earlier*
//! acquisition of that same `Mutex`; `SegmentWriter::publish_segment` is then
//! called afterward, in the segmenter's own program order, under a *later*
//! acquisition of the identical `Mutex`. Any third party that subsequently
//! acquires that lock — to poll any ring, from any thread — is guaranteed by
//! the transitivity of the `Mutex`'s release/acquire ordering to observe at
//! least everything the segmenter itself had already observed before it
//! published, samples included. So the specific ordering a consumer must
//! never see reversed (a segment's constituent samples appearing to lag
//! behind the segment itself) cannot happen. What *is* true, and is exactly
//! the existing [`RetentionClass::Timed`]/[`RetentionClass::Sparse`]
//! precedent extended one layer: the *global* order across unrelated
//! ring-group activity is not fixed by any one thread's program order any
//! more — a new, unrelated sample the ingest thread publishes concurrently
//! may land before or after a segment close the segmenter thread publishes,
//! in either order, depending on which wins the lock race. Nothing
//! downstream needs that unrelated cross-ring interleave to be
//! deterministic (see [Two retention classes](#two-retention-classes-and-why-they-are-two-independent-rings)
//! below for why this crate already treats "no global cross-ring order" as
//! an acceptable, load-bearing property, not a defect) — only the *causal*
//! one, which is what the shared `Mutex` structurally guarantees.
//!
//! # Why this module needs `std`, unlike its byte-layer siblings
//!
//! [`crate::byte_stage`], [`crate::byte_tap`], and [`crate::byte_merge`] are
//! `no_std` because each is driven synchronously by a single caller — there is
//! no cross-thread sharing to arrange. `Trunk` is different in kind: one
//! writer thread per ring group (ingest for samples/events; a segmenter for
//! segments/parts, once one exists) and an unbounded set of reader threads
//! (egress, analysis, DVR) must observe the *same* ring concurrently. That
//! needs a
//! shared, lockable interior — `std::sync::{Arc, Mutex}` here, matching
//! exactly the shape validated by `spikes/trunk-bench` (§3.1 of the spec).
//! Pulling in a `no_std` spinlock crate just to keep this one module
//! `no_std`-capable was considered and rejected: every real `Trunk` consumer
//! (`IngestSession`, `PushEgress`/`SegmentEgress`/`ServedEgress` impls) is
//! already `std`+`tokio` per the architecture, so there is no `no_std` caller
//! this would ever serve. This module is therefore `#[cfg(feature = "std")]`
//! — `media-plane --no-default-features` builds clean without it, exactly
//! like every other `std`-only corner of the workspace.
//!
//! # The benchmark verdict this design is built around
//!
//! `spikes/trunk-bench` (commit `acdbf3d0`) measured the naive
//! one-`Mutex`-guarded-log shape this module implements: **PASS** at the
//! specced scale (200-track MPTS × 6 readers, 999.97/1000 Mbit/s sustained,
//! publish mean 5.6 µs / p99 44.3 µs against a ~111 µs budget), but it
//! **refuted the original O(1)-fan-out premise** — writer cost is **O(N) in
//! cursor count** (956 ns → 9.98 µs from 1 → 16 readers), because writer and
//! readers all contend one shared `Mutex`.
//!
//! **Consequence, stated where it will actually be read:** see
//! [`Trunk::subscribe`]. A cursor is for a distinct *consumer of the stream*
//! — never one per peer of a one-to-many protocol. There is no tee, no
//! broadcast channel, and no per-consumer queue here, and there will not be
//! one added to chase higher fan-out: fan-out *is* `subscribe()`, and a
//! sample's payload is already [`bytes::Bytes`], so handing a clone to a
//! second, third, or sixteenth reader is a refcount bump, not a copy (see
//! [Zero-copy fan-out](#zero-copy-fan-out-honestly) below). If a route needs
//! to serve hundreds or thousands of peers (LL-HLS, WHEP), it takes **one**
//! cursor here and fans out to its peers itself, at the layer that already
//! has to hold per-peer state (congestion window, pacing epoch, SRTP
//! context) anyway.
//!
//! The segment log added in this step is a **sibling ring behind the same
//! one `Mutex`** (the internal `TrunkState`), not a second lock — a
//! [`SegmentCursor`] contends exactly the lock a [`SampleCursor`] does, so
//! the same O(N)-in-cursor-count rule and the same single-digit-reader
//! guidance apply to it verbatim; see [`Trunk::subscribe_segments`] and
//! [`Trunk::pin_segments`].
//!
//! # Two retention classes, and why they are two independent rings
//!
//! [`RetentionClass::Timed`] (regular-cadence media) and
//! [`RetentionClass::Sparse`] (irregular, semantically-critical entries — an
//! SCTE-35 splice cue, a subtitle sample) are **not** stored in one merged,
//! globally-ordered log. An earlier design considered exactly that: one
//! `VecDeque` in strict publish order, with `Sparse` entries migrated to a
//! small overflow buffer instead of being dropped when the main ring evicted
//! them. It was rejected as needless complexity for a property nothing
//! actually needs: nothing downstream reads a `Trunk` expecting a strict
//! chronological interleave of, say, video samples and SCTE-35 sections —
//! consumers correlate by PTS/DTS themselves, and the *real* requirement (see
//! [`RetentionClass::Sparse`]) is only that `Sparse` retention must never be
//! collateral damage from unrelated `Timed` churn. Two independently
//! capacity-bounded rings give that guarantee *by construction* — a flood of
//! video frames cannot evict a still-live splice cue, because there is
//! nowhere for it to reach it — while a single merged ring would have to
//! re-implement the same isolation by hand (the rejected overflow-buffer
//! design above), for no observable benefit. [`SampleCursor::poll`] merges
//! the two rings only at read time, and documents the (best-effort, not
//! globally-ordered) precedence it uses.
//!
//! # Zero-copy fan-out, honestly
//!
//! **This claim was made falsely on this project before**: an earlier
//! zero-copy fan-out claim was proven only by a test that sliced `Bytes`
//! itself, while the crate under test contained zero `.slice()` calls of its
//! own — i.e. the test manufactured the evidence it was supposed to be
//! checking for. So, stated plainly: **the production path in this module
//! achieves zero-copy fan-out, not only the test.** the internal per-class
//! log stores the [`transmux::Sample`] handed to it; [`SampleCursor::poll`] returns it to
//! a reader via [`Clone::clone`] on the whole `Sample`, which clones
//! `Sample.data: Bytes` through `Bytes`'s own `Clone` impl — an `Arc`-style
//! refcount bump, not a byte copy. There is no `.slice()`, no
//! `Bytes::copy_from_slice`, and no re-allocation anywhere on this path. The
//! test in this module (`payload_is_shared_not_copied_across_cursors`)
//! asserts `Bytes::as_ptr()` *identity* across multiple cursors reading the
//! same published entry, precisely so it cannot be satisfied by two payloads
//! that merely have equal contents — and a mutation swapping the `clone()`
//! for a real copy is recorded as run against it (see that test's doc
//! comment).
//!
//! The segment log added in this step makes the **same** claim, honestly, on
//! the **same** terms: [`SegmentEntry::bytes`] is [`bytes::Bytes`],
//! [`SegmentCursor::poll`] hands it back via `Clone` on the whole
//! [`SegmentEntry`] (which clones `Bytes` through `Bytes`'s own `Clone`), and
//! there is no `.slice()`/`copy_from_slice`/re-allocation anywhere on that
//! path either. `segment_bytes_are_shared_not_copied_across_cursors` asserts
//! the same pointer-identity property for segments that
//! `payload_is_shared_not_copied_across_cursors` asserts for samples — this
//! is the **production** path achieving zero-copy fan-out, not a test
//! manufacturing its own evidence.
//!
//! # The DVR contradiction: losslessness from retention, not back-pressure
//!
//! A DVR/archive consumer must not miss a segment — a hole in a recording is
//! a defect, not a degradation, unlike a dropped video frame. But the writer
//! must **never** block, for exactly the reason stated everywhere else in
//! this module: a stalled archive writer must not stall live ingest. Those
//! two requirements contradict each other directly if "losslessness" is
//! implemented the obvious way — by making the writer wait for a slow
//! archive reader.
//!
//! **The resolution: losslessness comes from retention, not from
//! back-pressure.** A [`SegmentCursor`] obtained via [`Trunk::pin_segments`]
//! *pins* every segment it has not yet consumed — the log will not evict a
//! pinned entry as a matter of course, the way it freely evicts for an
//! ordinary [`Trunk::subscribe_segments`] cursor. "Consumed" here means
//! "returned by [`SegmentCursor::poll`]" — the same progress counter that
//! already governs in-order delivery does double duty as the pin floor,
//! rather than adding a second, explicit acknowledge-after-durable-write API
//! call. That two-call shape (poll to receive, then a separate `ack` once
//! the archive write actually lands on disk) was considered — it is the more
//! conservative choice, since a consumer that has polled a segment but not
//! yet finished writing it to disk is not truly safe from loss if the trunk
//! evicts under it — and rejected for *this* step: it doubles the API
//! surface and the bookkeeping (two offsets per pin instead of one) for a
//! distinction (poll's delivery vs. a durable write landing) this step has
//! no test that needs, since nothing downstream is implemented yet
//! (`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-26-media-plane-implementation.md` step
//! 3d's `SegmentEgress`/DVR writer is what would consume it). If that step
//! needs the finer-grained split, it is additive — a second, later
//! acknowledgement point on the same pin — not a breaking change to this
//! one.
//!
//! **Pinning is bounded, and by design there is no second capacity knob for
//! it**: a pin is measured against exactly [`TrunkConfig::segment_capacity`],
//! the same bound that governs ordinary eviction for every cursor. There is
//! no independent "how far behind may a pin fall" setting to tune
//! separately and get wrong. When the segment log is at capacity and the
//! next [`SegmentWriter::publish_segment`] would evict an entry some pin has
//! not yet consumed, the bound has been hit, and something genuinely has to
//! give — the caller decided what, in advance, via the [`ArchiveOverrun`]
//! passed to [`Trunk::pin_segments`]:
//!
//! - [`ArchiveOverrun::Gap`] (**the default**) — evict the pinned entry
//!   anyway, and tell that cursor it lost data
//!   ([`SegmentCursorItem::Gap`]). The recording gets a hole; the live
//!   stream and every other cursor are unaffected.
//! - [`ArchiveOverrun::StallIngest`] — apply real back-pressure:
//!   [`SegmentWriter::publish_segment`] blocks until this cursor consumes
//!   enough to release its pin (or is dropped). **The only place in this
//!   entire design where a reader may block the writer** — opt-in,
//!   documented loudly here and on the variant itself, and never the
//!   default.
//! - [`ArchiveOverrun::Terminate`] — drop the cursor's pin outright instead
//!   of gapping the recording or stalling ingest; the cursor is done
//!   ([`SegmentCursorItem::Terminated`]) and the log continues without it.
//!
//! This is a genuine three-way trade between the recording, the live
//! stream, and the archive consumer — **no option is free**, and there is
//! deliberately no fourth "just make it work" variant: any such variant
//! would have to secretly pick one of the three trade-offs above anyway
//! (drop bytes, block the writer, or drop the consumer), just without
//! naming which — which is worse, not better.
//!
//! # The event log: 90 kHz absolute, and the B1 crux
//!
//! `TrunkState` (the shared state behind a `Trunk`) holds the two per-class
//! sample logs, the segment log, and now the event log — a **sibling ring
//! behind the same one `Mutex`**, exactly the pattern the segment log
//! established (`TrunkState::events: EventLog`, `Trunk::subscribe_events`/
//! `events_between`/`events_in_segment` shaped like `Trunk::subscribe`/
//! `Trunk::subscribe_segments`, `TrunkConfig::event_capacity` alongside
//! `timed_capacity`/`sparse_capacity`/`segment_capacity`). Where it is
//! genuinely a new shape, not a third `ClassLog`/`SegmentLog` copy, is
//! its *clock* and its *addressing* — both forced by architecture audit
//! finding B1
//! (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-26-media-plane-architecture.md` §0/§1.2).
//!
//! **What B1 got wrong.** Revision 1 of the spec claimed one time model for
//! everything the plane carries: an absolute `i64` in the *producing
//! track's* timescale. That is false in two ways this project already
//! parses, and both are events, not samples:
//!
//! - `splice_schedule.utc_splice_time` (SCTE-35 §9.7.4) is **GPS-epoch
//!   UTC** — not a media timestamp in any track's timescale at all.
//! - `emsg` version 0's `presentation_time_delta` (ISO/IEC 23009-1
//!   §5.10.3.3) is **segment-relative** — its value only means something
//!   once you know which segment it lands in, and that segment's earliest
//!   presentation time is not knowable until the segmenter has actually cut
//!   the boundary. `timed_metadata::convert::emsg_convert` already encodes
//!   this exact arithmetic (`T = EPT + presentation_time_delta`) for
//!   *converting* one emsg to another; the event log's job is different —
//!   it has to hold the delta *honestly unresolved* for however long the
//!   boundary is unknown, which a stateless conversion function has no
//!   reason to model.
//!
//! Neither of those is expressible as a single struct field without either
//! (a) losing information (which timescale? relative to what?) or (b)
//! **fabricating** a resolution that has not actually happened yet — an
//! event log that stores a plausible-looking media time for a
//! `splice_schedule` cue before any wall-clock↔media-clock mapping exists,
//! or for an `emsg` v0 before its segment's start is known, has invented
//! data. **The failure mode is not a crash: it is an ad break firing at the
//! wrong wall-clock instant**, because a plausible-but-wrong media time is
//! indistinguishable from a correct one until playout.
//!
//! **Why 90 kHz absolute, not per-track timescale.** A single `Media` can
//! carry several tracks at several timescales (48 kHz audio, a 25 fps
//! video track at 90 000, a subtitle track with none at all) — there is no
//! one track whose timescale the *event* log could borrow without an
//! arbitrary, undocumented choice among them. [`EventAnchor::Media`]
//! therefore carries [`timed_metadata::MediaTime`] — 90 kHz ticks,
//! wrap-unrolled, the same clock SCTE-35's own `pts_time` already uses —
//! rather than any one track's clock. This is also why the event log is a
//! genuinely separate ring from the sample rings, not a third
//! [`RetentionClass`]: a [`transmux::Sample`] is timestamped in its
//! *track's* clock ([`transmux::Sample::pts`]/`dts`, per §4 of the spec);
//! an event lives on the trunk's own, track-independent clock.
//!
//! **Carries [`timed_metadata::TimedEvent`], not a parallel type.** It is
//! owned, lossless, `#[non_exhaustive]`, and already published (0.4.0, live
//! on crates.io) — [`EventEntry::event`] stores it verbatim rather than
//! re-deriving a second event representation this crate would then have to
//! keep in sync by hand. `mp4_emsg::EmsgBox<'a>` is *borrowed* and cannot
//! outlive the buffer it was parsed from, so it cannot sit in a `'static`
//! ring; [`timed_metadata::SourcePayload::Emsg`] is already its owned form
//! (scheme/value/verbatim `message_data`), and is what ends up inside the
//! stored `TimedEvent` for an `emsg`-sourced entry.
//!
//! **The B1 crux: [`EventAnchor`] — an unresolved event stays honestly
//! unresolved.** Every entry's addressability is one of three states, and
//! there is deliberately no path from `Segment`/`Utc` to `Media` other than
//! the specific fact each one is waiting for actually arriving:
//!
//! - [`EventAnchor::Media`] — already on the trunk's 90 kHz clock (a
//!   `splice_time` PTS post-wrap-unroll, or an already-absolute `emsg` v1).
//! - [`EventAnchor::Segment`] — an `emsg` v0's `presentation_time_delta`
//!   plus the `segment_number` it is relative to. Stays exactly this
//!   variant — addressable by segment number, **not** by media time —
//!   until [`SegmentWriter::note_segment_start`] reports that segment's
//!   start, at which point this module's internal event log resolves it
//!   **in place**, computed from *that segment's own* reported start —
//!   never "whichever segment happens to be currently open", which would
//!   silently produce *a* segment instead of *the* segment the emsg
//!   actually named.
//! - [`EventAnchor::Utc`] — a GPS/UTC instant (`splice_schedule`) with no
//!   media-timeline position at all. Stays exactly this variant — not
//!   returned by [`Trunk::events_between`] or [`Trunk::events_in_segment`],
//!   because there is no honest media time to filter on — until
//!   [`SegmentWriter::set_time_anchor`] gives the event log a
//!   [`timed_metadata::TimeAnchor`] to translate through. This is the
//!   literal B1 test: an event with only a wall-clock time and no anchor
//!   must never be handed a fabricated media time.
//!
//! `epoch_ms_to_media` (the UTC→media direction) is the mirror image of
//! [`timed_metadata::TimeAnchor::media_to_epoch_ms`] (which only goes the
//! other way) — plain affine algebra, **not** a reimplementation of
//! [`timed_metadata::Timeline`]'s 33-bit wrap-unroll, which this module
//! reuses rather than hand-rolls: every `MediaTime` this ring ever stores
//! either came out of `Timeline::push_scte35` already unrolled, or is
//! computed from one that did (`Segment`/`Utc` resolution only ever adds a
//! non-negative delta or an anchor-relative offset to an already-unrolled
//! value).
//!
//! **Dual addressing: media time *and* segment, both, not either** — because
//! a manifest renderer needs "the events in segment N" while a playback
//! scheduler needs "the events between T1 and T2", and neither is a special
//! case of the other. [`Trunk::events_between`] answers the first
//! (half-open `[from, to)` over every currently-`Media`-resolved entry);
//! [`Trunk::events_in_segment`] answers the second, by consulting
//! `EventLog::segment_starts` — a small boundary table, populated by
//! [`SegmentWriter::note_segment_start`], bounded by the **same**
//! `TrunkConfig::event_capacity` rather than a second, independent knob
//! (exactly [`TrunkConfig::segment_capacity`]'s "no second capacity knob"
//! precedent for pinning). Both queries only ever return `Media`-resolved
//! entries — an entry still `Segment`/`Utc`-anchored is not fabricated a
//! position just to satisfy either query.
//!
//! Both point-in-time queries read the same log a subscribed
//! [`EventCursor`] does (via [`Trunk::subscribe_events`]) — the same
//! single-`Mutex`, single-digit-reader-by-design, in-band-loss-reporting,
//! writer-never-blocks shape [`Trunk::subscribe`]/[`Trunk::subscribe_segments`]
//! already established, reused verbatim rather than reconsidered: an
//! `EventCursor` sees an entry (and a `Lagged` loss report, if it fell
//! behind [`TrunkConfig::event_capacity`]'s eviction) the moment it is
//! published, whether or not it has resolved yet, while the two query
//! methods are a snapshot of what has resolved *so far*.
//!
//! `SegmentEgress` and tiered `Retention` (plan steps 3d/3e — an egress
//! trait that owns one [`SegmentCursor`] and pushes to DVR/MABR/ROUTE/Smooth,
//! and a hot/cold archive store behind it) are **not** built here, and their
//! attachment point is exactly [`Trunk::pin_segments`]: a `SegmentEgress`
//! implementation is the caller this step's [`ArchiveOverrun`] was written
//! for — it takes a pinning cursor with whichever policy its durability
//! contract requires (`StallIngest` for "this archive must never have a
//! hole", `Gap` for "best-effort is fine"), drains [`SegmentCursor::poll`],
//! and writes [`SegmentEntry::bytes`] to its store. Nothing in this step's
//! shape needs to change to make room for that; it is exactly the sample
//! path's `PushEgress`-owns-one-`SampleCursor` story repeated one layer up.
//! (`SegmentEgress`/`Retention` are named here only to document the
//! attachment point per this step's brief — neither type exists in this
//! crate yet.)
//!
//! # The live-part log: parts before their segment closes
//!
//! Step 3d built `ServedEgress`/`EgressResponse::Await` and, per its own
//! brief, read `hls-runtime/src/server/` before finishing to report what
//! did **not** fit. It found the segment log alone cannot serve LL-HLS at
//! all: RFC 8216bis's entire low-latency mechanism is **part-level**
//! availability ("does part 3 of the segment currently being written
//! exist"), and before this step there was nowhere in this `Trunk` to ask
//! that — the segment log holds only *finished* segments. This step adds a
//! fourth ring, the live-part log (`TrunkState::parts: PartLog`), storing
//! [`PartEntry`] exactly the way this module's internal `SegmentLog` stores [`SegmentEntry`] —
//! same evict-then-push shape, same zero-copy-fan-out claim (see
//! [Zero-copy fan-out](self#zero-copy-fan-out-honestly)) — bounded by the
//! new [`TrunkConfig::part_capacity`].
//!
//! **Addressed the way a client actually asks**: not a moving cursor
//! position, but a direct `(segment_number, part_index)` key —
//! [`Trunk::part_bytes`] and [`Trunk::parts_in_segment`], the live-part
//! counterparts of [`Trunk::events_between`]/[`Trunk::events_in_segment`].
//! This is deliberate, not an oversight of "should there also be a
//! `PartCursor`": a `ServedEgress` implementing LL-HLS resolves *random*
//! requests ("is part 3.2 ready") against whatever is currently true, not a
//! sequential stream of every part ever produced — exactly the same
//! resolve-a-request-against-shared-state shape
//! [`crate::egress::ServedEgress::resolve`]'s own module doc already argues
//! for the event log's snapshot queries. No `PartCursor` is added because no
//! test in this step (or in `crate::egress`) needs one; streaming every part
//! as it is produced (a hypothetical future low-latency `PushEgress`) is
//! additive later, not a gap today.
//!
//! **What happens when the parent segment closes — decided, not left
//! implicit**: [`SegmentWriter::publish_segment`] does **not** touch the
//! live-part log at all. A part stays addressable via [`Trunk::part_bytes`]
//! for exactly as long as [`TrunkConfig::part_capacity`]'s ordinary
//! evict-oldest bound has not yet reclaimed it — whether its parent segment
//! is still open or has already closed makes no difference to this ring.
//! Three alternatives were considered and rejected:
//!
//! - *Roll a closed segment's parts into its [`SegmentEntry`]* — rejected:
//!   `SegmentEntry::bytes` is already the whole muxed segment; attaching its
//!   parts too would store the same encoded media twice (once whole, once
//!   split), the opposite of this crate's zero-copy-fan-out discipline, for
//!   a property ([`Trunk::part_bytes`] already answers "is this part ready")
//!   nothing needs.
//! - *Evict a segment's parts the instant it closes* — rejected: this is
//!   the exact bug `hls_runtime::server::MediaStore`'s own `recent_parts`
//!   buffer exists to prevent (documented there as "the segmenter emits a
//!   segment's final part and closes the segment in the same pipeline
//!   step... without this the part is evicted microseconds after it
//!   appears — before the blocked part request can wake"). A `ServedEgress`
//!   built on this `Trunk` needs the same guarantee, and immediate eviction
//!   on close would remove it.
//! - *A second, shorter-lived "recently closed" bound, chained after the
//!   live bound* — this is what `MediaStore` actually does
//!   (`live_parts` + a separately-capped `recent_parts`, doubling worst-case
//!   retention) — rejected here as the "second knob" this file's precedent
//!   argues against: one bound, applied uniformly regardless of open/closed
//!   status, gives the same client-visible guarantee (a just-closed part
//!   stays fetchable) without a second, independently-tunable lifetime that
//!   can disagree with the first.
//!
//! **What a client requesting a just-rolled part receives**: the same
//! answer as the instant before the segment closed — `Some(bytes)` from
//! [`Trunk::part_bytes`] — because closing did not touch this ring. It
//! becomes `None` only once ordinary `part_capacity` eviction reclaims it,
//! at which point this ring cannot distinguish "evicted" from "never
//! existed"; a `ServedEgress` wanting RFC 8216bis's sharper "will never
//! exist, stop waiting" signal for a part of an *already-closed* segment
//! (`hls_runtime::server::MediaStore::resolve_resource`'s
//! `ResourceOutcome::NotFound` case) gets that distinction the same way
//! `MediaStore` itself does: by also consulting [`Trunk::last_closed_segment`]
//! — if the requested part's `segment_number` is at or before that value
//! and [`Trunk::part_bytes`] answers `None`, the part will never arrive; if
//! it is beyond it, the segment (and the part) may still be produced.
//!
//! # The reader-wake primitive: `listen`, not one registration per remote peer
//!
//! The second gap step 3d found, recorded rather than solved: every `Trunk`
//! reader was a synchronous, non-blocking `poll()`, so a `ServedEgress`
//! implementing RFC 8216bis §6.2.5.2 blocking reload had nothing to wait
//! *on* — only a poll-with-backoff loop. [`Trunk::listen`] closes that gap
//! by handing back a [`ProgressListener`] wrapping
//! [`event_listener::EventListener`] — the exact runtime-agnostic primitive
//! `hls_runtime::server::MediaStore::listen` already returns (an already
//! std+`event-listener`-feature dependency of this crate's sibling, and now
//! of this one), not a hand-rolled parallel mechanism, so a caller ports
//! mechanically: `.await` it under any executor, or call
//! [`ProgressListener::wait_deadline`] with no executor at all — precisely
//! `MediaStore::listen`'s own two documented ways to wait.
//!
//! **The writer never blocks on this.** [`SegmentWriter::publish_part`]/
//! [`SegmentWriter::publish_segment`] call `Event::notify(usize::MAX)`, which
//! wakes every currently-registered listener without waiting for any of
//! them to actually resume running — the same non-blocking-producer
//! guarantee this module makes everywhere else
//! ([`TrunkWriter::publish`]'s doc), extended to a wake channel instead of a
//! data ring. A registered [`ProgressListener`] that nobody ever polls or
//! waits on again (a vanished HTTP peer, a wedged executor) costs the
//! writer nothing beyond that one `notify` call's O(waiter-count) fan-out —
//! it never becomes a wait.
//!
//! **Bounded, and reusing [`TrunkConfig::part_capacity`] rather than a sixth
//! knob.** [`Trunk::listen`] refuses (`None`) once `part_capacity`
//! concurrent [`ProgressListener`]s are outstanding. This is deliberately
//! **not** sized "one registration per remote viewer": that would repeat
//! exactly the O(N)-in-cursor-count mistake [`Trunk::subscribe`]'s own docs
//! warn against for data cursors, now for wake registrations instead of
//! poll positions. The intended shape mirrors `subscribe`'s "one cursor per
//! distinct consumer, never one per peer" rule: a `ServedEgress` adapter
//! serving a thousand LL-HLS viewers takes **one** (or a small, fixed
//! number of) [`Trunk::listen`] registration(s) for the route and fans the
//! single wake-up out to its own thousand blocked HTTP handlers itself,
//! using its own broadcast mechanism — exactly the same layering
//! [`crate::egress::PushEgress`] already requires for sample fan-out. Under
//! that shape, `part_capacity`-many concurrent *distinct-consumer*
//! registrations is generous headroom, not a production ceiling; if a
//! caller instead wires one HTTP request directly to one `Trunk::listen`
//! call each (mirroring how `MediaStore`'s single, uncapped `Event` is used
//! today), the cap is exactly the backstop this step exists to add — a
//! caller hitting `None` must treat it the same way it treats an already-
//! expired [`crate::egress::AwaitPolicy`]: answer the request as
//! unavailable now rather than waiting with no slot to wait in. Composing
//! with [`crate::egress::AwaitPolicy`]'s deadline is the caller's
//! conversion of `AwaitPolicy::deadline` (a [`Timestamp`]) to the
//! `std::time::Instant` it already anchors that `Timestamp` to, passed to
//! [`ProgressListener::wait_deadline`] (or wrapped in the caller's own
//! executor timeout around the `Future` impl) — see
//! [`ProgressListener::wait_deadline`]'s own doc.
