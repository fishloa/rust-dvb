# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.1] - 2026-08-16

### Added
- `Trunk::time_anchor()` — public getter for the wall-clock anchor the
  trunk's event log has been given via `SegmentWriter::set_time_anchor`,
  returning `None` until one has been set. Needed by `hls-runtime` 0.7.0
  to build a `timed_metadata::Timeline` for `EXT-X-DATERANGE` rendering
  (issue #965).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-08-11

### Changed
- MSRV raised to **1.95.0** (issue #949). This removes the workspace's MSRV
  split: `webrtc-runtime`'s optional `media` feature needed rustc 1.88 (via
  `rcgen`), which had grown a dedicated CI job, six `--exclude` lanes and a
  guard script to contain. Adopting let-chains and `is_multiple_of` where the
  1.95 lints require them; no functional or API change.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-05

### Added
- `TrunkWriter::set_tracks` now wakes `Trunk::progress` listeners (issue #781),
  so a `Trunk::listen` registration is notified when a track-set change arrives
  mid-stream — the same wake channel `SegmentWriter::publish_part`/`publish_segment`
  already use. Previously, `set_tracks` bumped `track_generation` but did not
  notify waiters, so a consumer polling on `listen()` could stall indefinitely
  through a mid-stream track addition.

### Changed
- Requires `transmux` 0.23 (epoch-pure caret bump from ^0.22; the
  `TrackSpec::program_number` field added in 0.23.0 is part of this
  crate's public API via `Trunk`).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-02

### Changed

- Requires `transmux` 0.22, which moved M3U8 playlist syntax out to the new
  `broadcast-hls` crate. **No API or behaviour change in this crate** — the
  bump exists because `transmux` crossed a pre-1.0 caret boundary (`^0.21` ->
  `^0.22`), and a dependent that keeps the old requirement lets a consumer
  resolve two incompatible `transmux` copies into one graph (issue #858).

## [0.1.2] - 2026-07-30

### Fixed
- Floor `timed-metadata` to `0.4.1`. The `^0.4` bucket also contains 0.4.0,
  which is built against `broadcast-common` 8, so a consumer could resolve two
  `broadcast-common` majors into one graph and hit trait-resolution errors
  pointing at this crate's internals (#858).

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-30

### Added
- `tests/non_exhaustive_coverage.rs` drift guard (issue #806). No public API
  or behaviour change.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-28

### Changed (pre-1.0 hardening)
- **`TapItem` is now `#[non_exhaustive]`.** It was the only public enum in this
  crate without it, while its two closest analogues — `SampleCursorItem` and
  `SegmentCursorItem`, the same shape of data interleaved with in-band loss
  reports — both carry it. The sample ring already distinguishes ordinary
  `Lagged` from escalated `Degraded`, so a second loss class on the tap is a
  plausible near-term addition, and adding a variant to a published exhaustive
  enum is breaking. Free to fix before 0.1.0 ships; not afterwards.
  - Note for downstream matchers, including **examples and integration tests
    of this crate itself**: those compile as separate crates, so the attribute
    applies to them exactly as to an external consumer. This crate's own
    `byte_tap_wire_observer` example and its fuzz target both needed a
    catch-all arm — each `panic!`s on an unrecognised variant rather than
    absorbing it, since silently counting a future loss class as delivered
    data (or as nothing) is precisely the miscount `TapItem` exists to
    prevent.

### Added (issue #808)
- **`Trunk::subscribe_from_backlog`**: a [`SampleCursor`] seek-to-past variant
  next to `Trunk::subscribe`, for a consumer built *after* samples it needs
  have already landed in the ring (e.g. a segmenter reacting to the very
  `feed` batch that also announced its program — MPEG-TS routinely carries
  the PMT and the first PES samples together). Starts each retention class
  (`Timed`/`Sparse`) independently at that ring's own current `base` (the
  oldest entry still resident), so replay is bounded by ring capacity, never
  unbounded, and never double-reports data already evicted before the
  subscribe call as this cursor's own loss. `Lagged`/`Degraded` still fire
  in-band for any loss *after* subscribing, exactly as for `subscribe`'s
  cursor. Carries the same fan-out warning as `subscribe` (writer cost is
  O(N) in cursor count — a cursor is per distinct consumer, never per peer).

### Changed (BREAKING — plan step 5a, round 3)
- **`IngestSession` no longer pins `Stage::In` to `&'a [u8]`, and gains an
  associated `Request` type.** The supertrait bound relaxes from
  `for<'a> Stage<In<'a> = &'a [u8], Out = SessionEvent> + Send` to
  `for<'a> Stage<Out = SessionEvent> + Send`, and `poll_transmit` now returns
  `Option<Self::Request>` rather than `Option<Bytes>`. `IngestDriver::feed`
  becomes generic over `S::In<'_>`; `IngestDriver::poll_transmit` returns
  `Option<S::Request>`. `ListenDriver::feed` deliberately keeps its `&[u8]`
  input (behind a `where L::Session: for<'a> Stage<In<'a> = &'a [u8]>`
  bound): every `Listener` implementor is a push accept over a byte-stream
  transport, never a pull source (which dials out via `Dialer`).
  - **Migration** (every implementor, one line): a byte-stream source adds
    `type Request = bytes::Bytes;` — no behaviour change. A pull source
    (`multimux::source::{hls_pull, dash_pull, smooth_pull}`) states its own
    honest shape instead, e.g. `type In<'a> = (HlsFetchId, &'a [u8]);
    type Request = ll_hls_runtime::client::Action;`.
  - **Why `Request` is opaque to the plane, and why an `Inbound` enum was
    rejected**: recorded in full in `ingress`'s module docs under
    *"Pull sources need a typed request/response identity (round 3)"*,
    replacing round 2's *"Known seam"* section. The short version: a
    per-source escape-hatch method would leave `Stage::feed` never called on
    a pull session while the trait bound still advertises it as the way in —
    **a type that lies about the contract it implements**; and a fixed
    `Inbound { Bytes, Response { id, .. } }` enum would force every stream
    source to match a variant that cannot occur for it *and* bake pull
    vocabulary (`ResourceId`/`Action`) into `media-plane`, which is exactly
    the protocol knowledge this crate exists to stay free of.
- **`IngestDriver::session()`** (new): read-only access to the driven
  session, for state a driver loop must observe that `SessionEvent`/
  `HealthState` cannot carry. Concretely: a pull source knows it has reached
  true end-of-stream from its own protocol bookkeeping (an `#EXT-X-ENDLIST`
  with every named fetch accounted for; a static MPD/manifest with every
  plan exhausted), whereas a byte-stream transport's "ended" signal is
  external and already known to the driver loop. `SessionEvent` gains no
  `Ended` variant for this, per its own "no variant without a correct
  producer" discipline.

### Added
- New crate: `media-plane`, the media-plane integration layer (plan step 3a-i).
- `ByteStage`: the pre-demux byte-to-byte stage contract, defined as
  `Stage<In<'a> = &'a [u8], Out = Bytes>` rather than a second drive trait
  (per the 2026-07-27 revision of `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-26-media-plane-architecture.md`
  §1.1). Validated to compile at MSRV 1.86.
- `no_std` + `alloc` crate skeleton with a `std` feature, mirroring `transmux`.
- `ByteTap` (plan step 3a-ii): a positional, non-blocking observer of bytes
  in the byte layer, yielding `(Bytes, Timestamp)` exactly as received —
  including bytes a demuxer will reject (bad sync byte, TEI set, bad CRC,
  unaligned framing) — via a bounded ring. The producer (`record`) never
  blocks and never grows the ring past its configured capacity; a slow
  consumer instead observes an in-band `TapItem::Lagged { skipped }` from
  `poll`, which cannot be missed the way a side-channel counter could be.
  `TapPoint::{Wire, PostTransform}` is descriptive metadata only. Not a
  `Stage` — it is fed and polled by different callers, not driven as one
  contract.
- `ByteMerge` (plan step 3a-ii): the one bounded multi-input primitive in the
  byte layer — `N` byte sources reduced to one output stream of discrete
  messages (never an undelimited byte soup). `MergePolicy::FirstArrival`
  interleaves every source in arrival order; `MergePolicy::Failover` prefers
  a primary source, switches to a secondary after a configurable silence
  timeout (reset by any primary message, so a single late arrival does not
  cause a spurious switch), and switches back to primary the instant it is
  heard from again. `MergePolicy` is `#[non_exhaustive]`; ST 2022-7 hitless
  switching (`Hitless2022_7`) is deliberately **absent, not stubbed** — it
  needs RTP sequence-number semantics this layer does not have and lands
  with #752. Per-source state and the output queue are both bounded
  independently of call volume (`MergeError::QueueFull` rejects outright
  once the queue is at its cap, rather than growing or evicting silently).
- `Trunk`, `TrunkWriter`, `SampleCursor` (plan step 3b-i, `std`-only): the
  sample path of the `Trunk` — the bounded sample ring, its single writer,
  and the cursor(s) that read it. Two independent retention classes,
  `RetentionClass::Timed` (regular-cadence media, ordinary count-bounded
  eviction) and `RetentionClass::Sparse` (irregular, semantically-critical
  entries such as SCTE-35 cues), each with its **own** capacity so a flood of
  `Timed` publishes can never evict a still-live `Sparse` entry. A `Trunk`
  has exactly one `TrunkWriter` (`Trunk::writer()` returns `None` on every
  call after the first); `TrunkWriter::publish` never blocks or rejects — a
  full ring evicts its oldest entry rather than waiting on a slow reader.
  `Trunk::subscribe()` returns a `SampleCursor` starting from "now"; loss is
  reported in-band via `SampleCursorItem::Lagged` (ordinary, `Timed`) or
  `SampleCursorItem::Degraded` (escalated, `Sparse` — the consumer's derived
  state is now wrong, not merely gapped), following `ByteTap`'s `TapItem`
  precedent so loss can never be skipped past via a side channel. Adds a
  `transmux` (`Sample`) dependency, `std`-gated: `spikes/trunk-bench`
  (spec §3.1) showed writer cost is O(N) in cursor count, so `subscribe()`
  documents — at the call site, not only in the module docs — that a cursor
  is for one distinct consumer of the stream, never one per peer of a
  one-to-many protocol; supported reader count is single-digit by design.
  Payload fan-out is a `Bytes` refcount bump on the production path (no
  `.slice()`/copy anywhere in this module), verified by pointer-identity
  assertion, not content equality.
- `SegmentEntry`, `SegmentCursor`, `ArchiveOverrun` (plan step 3b-ii,
  `std`-only): the segment log — a bounded, append-ordered log of finished
  media segments in playlist order, recorded alongside the sample ring on
  the same `Trunk`/`TrunkWriter`/one-`Mutex` shape. `SegmentEntry` reuses
  `transmux::SegmentMeta` for the discontinuity bit (embedding the whole
  type rather than copying the field out, so a future `SegmentMeta` field is
  picked up automatically) and adds the three fields nothing in `transmux`
  computes: `sequence_number`, wall-clock `duration`, and the segment's
  `timeline_position` on the trunk's absolute clock.
  `Trunk::subscribe_segments()` gives an ordinary, lossy-on-overflow cursor
  (`SegmentCursorItem::Lagged`, exactly `RetentionClass::Timed`'s contract);
  `Trunk::pin_segments(on_overrun)` gives a **pinning** cursor for a
  DVR/archive consumer that must not miss a segment. Resolves the DVR
  contradiction (a recording must not have a hole, but the writer must never
  block) as **losslessness from retention, not back-pressure**: a pinning
  cursor holds every not-yet-consumed segment retained up to
  `TrunkConfig::segment_capacity` — the same bound ordinary eviction uses,
  not a second independent knob — and when that bound is finally hit, the
  caller's chosen `ArchiveOverrun` decides what gives: `ArchiveOverrun::Gap`
  (default) evicts and reports `SegmentCursorItem::Gap` (a hole in the
  recording, stream survives); `ArchiveOverrun::StallIngest` applies real
  back-pressure — the *one* place in this design a reader may block the
  writer, opt-in and never the default; `ArchiveOverrun::Terminate` drops
  the cursor (`SegmentCursorItem::Terminated`) instead of gapping or
  stalling. Segment bytes are shared, not copied, across cursors on the
  production path, on the same terms and with the same pointer-identity
  test discipline as the sample ring's payload sharing. `SegmentEgress`/
  tiered `Retention` (plan steps 3d/3e) are not built here;
  `Trunk::pin_segments` is their documented attachment point.
- `EventAnchor`, `EventEntry`, `EventCursor` (plan step 3b-iii, `std`-only):
  the 90 kHz event log, completing the `Trunk` per
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-26-media-plane-architecture.md` §1.2 and
  resolving the architecture audit's **blocking finding B1** — rev 1's false
  claim that every event fits one absolute `i64` in track timescale, which
  is untrue for SCTE-35 `splice_schedule.utc_splice_time` (GPS-epoch UTC,
  not a media timestamp) and `emsg` v0's `presentation_time_delta`
  (segment-relative, unresolvable until the segmenter owns a boundary). The
  event log's reference clock is **90 kHz absolute**
  (`timed_metadata::MediaTime`), not any one track's timescale — a `Media`
  with several tracks at several timescales has no single track clock an
  event log could borrow. It carries `timed_metadata::TimedEvent` (owned,
  lossless, `#[non_exhaustive]`, already published at 0.4.0) verbatim rather
  than a parallel type; `mp4_emsg::EmsgBox<'a>` is borrowed and cannot be
  stored, `timed_metadata::SourcePayload::Emsg` already is its owned form.
  **The B1 fix itself is `EventAnchor`**: every entry is `Media` (already on
  the trunk's clock), `Segment { segment_number, delta }` (an `emsg` v0,
  stays exactly this variant — addressable by segment number only — until
  `TrunkWriter::note_segment_start` reports *that* segment's own start, and
  resolves against it specifically, never against whichever segment happens
  to be open), or `Utc { utc_epoch_ms }` (a GPS/UTC-only `splice_schedule`
  cue, stays exactly this variant, with **no fabricated media time**, until
  `TrunkWriter::set_time_anchor` gives the log a `timed_metadata::TimeAnchor`
  to translate through). Addressable **both** by media time
  (`Trunk::events_between`, half-open `[from, to)`) and by segment
  (`Trunk::events_in_segment`, via a small boundary table bounded by the
  same `TrunkConfig::event_capacity` rather than a second knob — the same
  "no second capacity knob" precedent `TrunkConfig::segment_capacity`
  already set for pinning) — both queries only ever return `Media`-resolved
  entries. `Trunk::subscribe_events()` gives a streaming `EventCursor` on the
  same one-`Mutex`, single-digit-reader-by-design, in-band-`Lagged`,
  writer-never-blocks shape the sample/segment cursors already established.
  Reuses `timed_metadata::Timeline`'s 33-bit PTS wrap-unroll rather than
  hand-rolling it; `timed-metadata` becomes a real (non-dev) dependency of
  `media-plane`.
- `Dialer`, `Listener`, `IngestSession`, `run_dial`/`run_listen` (plan step
  3c, `std`-only, new `ingress` module): the ingress traits and the generic
  drivers that pump them into a `Trunk`, so no protocol reimplements its own
  feed/poll/dispatch loop (every one of `multimux`'s nine sources hand-rolls
  this today). `IngestSession` is a `Stage<In<'a> = &'a [u8], Out =
  SessionEvent>` specialisation plus a `poll_transmit` hook, implemented
  explicitly (**not** blanket like `ByteStage`, which adds nothing — a blanket
  impl would make `poll_transmit`'s default impossible to override, breaking
  the handshake mechanism it exists for; documented on the trait).
  - **Establishment is sans-IO, through the ordinary pump.** `Dialer::dial`
    performs **no I/O and completes no handshake** — it constructs a session
    in a not-yet-established state along with its first outbound request. The
    handshake then completes through the same feed/poll pump as everything
    else: `poll_transmit` out, `Stage::feed` in, until the session emits
    `SessionEvent::Established`. This mirrors `rtsp-runtime`'s existing
    driveable `ClientSession` (request builders return bytes to send,
    `handle_data` consumes replies and returns events, phase readable via
    `state()`) rather than inventing a second pattern, and keeps tokio out of
    the layer: an earlier revision had `dial()` "perform the whole
    connect/handshake", which only ever fit sources whose connect is purely
    local and would have forced an executor bridge for RTSP/SRT-caller/TS-UDP.
    A separate `PendingSession` type was considered and rejected (it would
    duplicate `feed`/`poll_transmit`/`next_deadline`/`on_deadline` for one bit
    of state; `rtsp-runtime` does not do it either) — the phase is visible as
    `HealthState::Establishing` vs `Live`.
  - **The handshake is bounded** by `HandshakePolicy::establish_by`, an
    absolute caller-supplied `Timestamp`; past it a still-establishing session
    terminates as `HealthState::HandshakeTimedOut { deadline }` and, in a
    `ListenDriver`, is **reaped**, freeing its `max_sessions` slot — so a flood
    of half-open connections cannot squat the bound. A deadline rather than an
    attempt/pump-iteration cap because the failure mode is wall-clock (matching
    `multimux`'s already-proven `IngestTimeouts::connect`) and because a real
    RTSP handshake is DESCRIBE + SETUP × N + PLAY with N unknowable up front,
    so any fixed iteration cap is either too small for a real multi-track SDP
    or too large to bound anything. `IngestDriver::next_deadline` surfaces it
    while establishing; per this crate's sans-IO rule there is no internal
    timer.
  - **B5 (the program dimension)**: `SessionEvent::NewProgram` may be
    announced at any point in a session's lifetime, not only at the start.
    `IngestDriver`/`ListenDriver` mint a fresh `Trunk` per `ProgramId` the
    instant it is announced — including a second program on an already-live
    connection — closing the gap `multimux::source::ts_udp::TsUdpSession`
    has today (a post-connect `DemuxEvent::TrackAdded` is only logged and
    dropped).
  - **EOF vs failure**: `HealthState<E>`
    (`Establishing`/`Live`/`Ended`/`Failed(E)`/`HandshakeTimedOut`) fixes the
    bug that made `ll_hls_runtime::server::store::HealthState::Failed`
    unproducible — `multimux::origin::supervisor::supervise` today folds a
    clean `run_pipeline` EOF and a real error into the same `Reconnecting`
    transition. `Stage::finish` returning `Ok(())` drives `Ended`;
    `feed`/`finish` returning `Err` drives `Failed`, carrying the concrete
    error rather than a formatted string. `HandshakeTimedOut` is deliberately
    *not* folded into `Failed`: a handshake that never progressed produced no
    session error to carry, so inventing an `E` would mean fabricating one.
  - **`max_sessions` is a hard bound, enforced by `ListenDriver`**, not by
    each `Listener` implementation: once `max_sessions` sessions are
    admitted, every further accepted connection is dropped immediately,
    before being fed a single byte — never queued, never buffered.
  - **Reconnect is bounded and caller-chosen**: `ReconnectPolicy` bounds how
    many times `DialSupervisor` retries `Dialer::dial`; it never sleeps or
    decides backoff duration itself (`DialAttempt::Exhausted` is an `O(1)`
    no-op once `max_attempts` is spent — a permanently-failing dialer cannot
    spin or grow).
  - **Known seam, recorded not solved**: `multimux`'s HLS/DASH/Smooth *pull*
    sources are request-driven (playlist reload timer + whole-object GETs), not
    stream-driven. `feed(&[u8])` is fine for them (`Stage` says nothing about
    chunk size), and `next_deadline`/`on_deadline` already *is* a reload timer;
    the real gap is that `poll_transmit() -> Option<Bytes>` cannot express
    "GET this URL". That wants a request-*addressing* type, not a second drive
    model or a pull-shaped sibling trait — deferred to Step 5, when the first
    real caller exists.
- `ServedEgress`, `PushEgress`, `SegmentEgress` (plan step 3d, `std`-only, new
  `egress` module): the three egress traits, kept separate rather than unified
  because they are structurally different operations — resolve a request
  (`ServedEgress`), stream existing samples (`PushEgress`), consume finished
  segments (`SegmentEgress`) — not three configurations of one interface (see
  the module docs for why a merge attempt forces an unreachable branch either
  way).
  - **`ServedEgress::resolve` takes no `&Trunk`**, correcting the architecture
    spec's pseudocode after reading `ll-hls-runtime/src/server/`: the segment
    log has only a moving `SegmentCursor`, no snapshot/random-access query the
    way the event log has `events_between`, so every real implementation would
    ignore a passed-in `&Trunk` and consult its own synced cache instead
    (exactly what `MediaStore` already does, fed by `add_segment`/`add_part`
    separately from its `resolve_*` read side). `resolve` is bounded instead by
    `AwaitPolicy`/`EgressResponse::Await`, mirroring
    `HandshakePolicy::establish_by`'s absolute-deadline shape; `Trunk` has no
    reader-side notify primitive today (only a writer-side `Condvar` for
    `ArchiveOverrun::StallIngest`), so an adapter must poll-with-backoff bounded
    by the same policy — recorded as a gap for Step 4 to decide on, not solved
    here.
  - **`EgressResponse::Await` is bounded by construction**: `AwaitPolicy::expired`
    and `EgressResponse::pending` are real, mutation-tested code (not a
    documented convention) that turns "not ready" into `Await` before a
    caller-chosen deadline and `NotFound` after it — a hostile client asking
    for a part that never arrives cannot park a request forever.
  - **`PushEgress`** owns exactly one `SampleCursor` (never one per peer,
    matching `Trunk::subscribe`'s O(N)-in-cursor-count finding) and `send`
    takes one `&SampleCursorItem` per call (including `Lagged`/`Degraded`),
    reusing the cursor's own item type rather than inventing the architecture
    spec's unimplemented `TrackBatch`. `poll_transmit` mirrors
    `IngestSession::poll_transmit`'s `None`-default exactly.
  - **`PushEgress::renegotiate`** is the mechanism issue #781 needs (a
    mid-stream track addition currently cannot reach a running segmenter):
    given the current `&[TrackSpec]`, it returns `NegotiationOutcome::Accepted`
    with the new selection, or `NegotiationOutcome::Refused { reason }` when
    the output cannot honour the change without breaking an already-established
    peer contract (an answered WHEP SDP offer, an already-published DASH
    `Period`) — a truthful, in-band refusal rather than a silent drop or a
    fabricated `Accepted`.
  - **`SegmentEgress::on_segment`** takes `&SegmentCursorItem` verbatim,
    reusing 3b-ii's pinning/`ArchiveOverrun` rather than reimplementing it; the
    architecture spec's sketched `on_manifest(&ManifestSnapshot)` is
    deliberately not included — no concrete DVR/MABR/ROUTE/Smooth producer
    exists yet to shape a single `ManifestSnapshot` type honestly.
- `Trunk` live-part log and reader-wake primitive (plan step 3b-iv,
  `std`-only): the two gaps step 3d found while reading
  `ll-hls-runtime/src/server/` before finishing the egress traits, closed so
  Step 4 can actually render blocking-reload decisions from `&Trunk` instead
  of keeping `MediaStore` as a parallel store.
  - **`PartEntry`/`TrunkWriter::publish_part`**: a fourth bounded ring
    (`TrunkConfig::part_capacity`) holding parts of the segment currently
    being written — RFC 8216bis §4.4.4.9's independently-fetchable CMAF
    chunks — addressed directly by `(segment_number, part_index)` via
    `Trunk::part_bytes`/`Trunk::parts_in_segment` (the live-part
    counterparts of `Trunk::events_between`/`events_in_segment`), not a
    moving cursor: a `ServedEgress` resolves *random* part requests, it does
    not stream every part ever produced. `Trunk::last_closed_segment` closes
    the companion gap (distinguishing "segment N is closed" from "segment N
    merely has live parts", RFC 8216bis's bare-`_HLS_msn` condition).
  - **Segment close does not touch the part log** — a deliberate choice,
    not an oversight: `TrunkWriter::publish_segment` never evicts or
    transforms that segment's parts, so a client requesting a just-rolled
    part gets exactly the same `Some(bytes)` answer as before the close,
    closing the exact preload-hint race `ll_hls_runtime::server::MediaStore`'s
    `recent_parts` buffer exists to patch — without `MediaStore`'s
    second, independently-tuned "recently closed" bound chained after the
    first. A part is reclaimed only by `part_capacity`'s ordinary
    evict-oldest bound, whether its segment is open or closed.
  - **`Trunk::listen`/`ProgressListener`**: a bounded reader-wake primitive
    wrapping `event_listener::EventListener` — the same runtime-agnostic
    primitive `ll_hls_runtime::server::MediaStore::listen` already returns,
    reused rather than hand-rolled, so a `ServedEgress` adapter ports
    mechanically (`.await` under any executor, or
    `ProgressListener::wait_deadline` with none). `publish_part`/
    `publish_segment` wake registered listeners via `Event::notify`, which
    never waits for a listener to actually resume — the writer-never-blocks
    invariant holds for the wake channel exactly as it does for every data
    ring in this module. `Trunk::listen` refuses (`None`) once
    `part_capacity` concurrent registrations are outstanding — reusing that
    bound rather than adding a sixth, independent one — deliberately sized
    for "one registration per distinct consumer" (mirroring
    `Trunk::subscribe`'s fan-out rule), not one per remote peer; an adapter
    serving many viewers takes one registration and fans the wake-up out to
    its own peers itself.
  - `TrunkConfig::new` now takes a fifth `part_capacity` argument
    (**breaking**, pre-1.0).
- **`TrunkConfig`'s five capacities are now `NonZeroUsize`, not `usize`**
  (**breaking**, pre-1.0 — both the `TrunkConfig::new` signature and the five
  public struct fields, so a zero cannot be reintroduced by field assignment
  after construction). `Trunk::new`'s five `assert!(… > 0)` panics are
  **removed**: a zero capacity is now unrepresentable rather than rejected at
  run time.
  - Fixes an inherited inconsistency with `transmux::ProgressiveDemux::new`,
    which was deliberately changed from panicking-on-zero to fallible
    construction — the opposite rule two crates over made the API feel
    arbitrary.
  - Fixes a real operational hazard, not just a style point: `multimux` takes
    its routes from a JSON config file, so once trunk capacities become
    operator-configurable (Step 5) a stray `0` would have panicked the server
    process. A `serde` deserialize of `0` into a `NonZeroUsize` field instead
    fails as an ordinary config/deserialization error at the parse boundary,
    with no hand-written check anywhere.
  - `NonZeroUsize` was chosen over a fallible `TrunkConfig::new -> Result`
    because `TrunkConfig` (unlike `ProgressiveDemux`) has no error type and
    does not otherwise return `Result`, so `Result` would mean inventing a
    construction error and threading `?`/`unwrap` through every call site to
    encode one bit the type system carries for free — and the invariant lives
    in the signature, where a reader sees it without reading the docs.
  - The five `zero_*_capacity_panics` tests are **deleted** rather than
    rewritten: they asserted a panic that can no longer occur, and a rewritten
    version would only be asserting that `NonZeroUsize::new(0)` returns `None`
    (a `core` property, not this crate's).
- `Retention`, `SegmentSink`, `RetentionDriver`, `SegmentLocation`, `SinkOutcome`
  (plan step 3e, `std`-only, new `retention` module): the hot/cold archive
  policy layered on top of the segment log — the last functional piece of the
  plane (step 3f is acceptance furniture only).
  - **`SegmentSink` is sans-IO**: `offer(&SegmentEntry) -> SinkOutcome` touches
    no filesystem, socket, or executor; a real disk/object-store adapter (Step
    5) does its actual I/O entirely behind that synchronous boundary.
  - **`Retention::Tiered { on_overrun, cold_window }` reuses `ArchiveOverrun`
    verbatim**, not a parallel enum: `RetentionDriver` is built directly on
    `Trunk::pin_segments(on_overrun)`, so the same three-way Gap/StallIngest/
    Terminate trade 3b-ii already proved governs this layer too. Only
    `cold_window` (a `Duration`, not a `NonZeroUsize` — it bounds an eviction
    deadline, not a ring's structural capacity) is genuinely new state; the
    plan sketch's `hot`/`cold` fields are `ArchiveOverrun` (reused) and
    `SegmentSink` (supplied separately, at `RetentionDriver::new`, since a
    sink is a caller-supplied handle, not `Copy` policy data) respectively.
  - **A failing or slow sink cannot stall ingest**: `TrunkWriter::publish_segment`
    has no reference to `SegmentSink` at all — a structural guarantee, not a
    race defended against — and `RetentionDriver::drive` holds at most one
    `SegmentEntry` awaiting hand-off (`RetentionDriver::pending_len` is always
    `0` or `1`), never polling its pinning cursor for the next segment while
    one is stuck on `SinkOutcome::Busy`. No second bounded queue was added for
    this: everything still queued behind a stuck hand-off stays inside the
    trunk's segment log, already bounded by `segment_capacity` and already
    governed by `on_overrun`.
  - **Cold segments stay addressable — "cold, ask the sink"** (issue #746,
    DVR/catch-up): `RetentionDriver::locate(sequence_number, now)` resolves to
    `SegmentLocation::Hot` (still, or not yet, on the trunk's ordinary hot-ring
    path), `SegmentLocation::Cold` (handed off and still inside `cold_window`
    — this crate does not hold the bytes; the caller resolves them through its
    own sink), or `SegmentLocation::Evicted` (gapped before hand-off, or aged
    out of the cold window). Reuses `Trunk::last_closed_segment` for "has this
    sequence number even been produced yet" rather than tracking a second,
    parallel high-water mark.
  - The cold-tier ledger is bounded by `cold_window` itself (purged on every
    `drive`/`locate` call), the temporal analogue of `segment_capacity`'s
    count-based bound on the hot ring — not a second, independently-tuned
    count knob.
- Step 3f: `docs/CRATE-ACCEPTANCE.md` furniture — no behaviour change.
  - Three fuzz targets in the shared `fuzz/` crate: `media_plane_byte_merge`
    (arbitrary `feed`/`poll`/`on_deadline` sequences under both
    `MergePolicy` variants, asserting the output queue bound holds),
    `media_plane_byte_tap` (arbitrary `record`/`poll` interleavings,
    asserting the ring bound holds and every recorded item is accounted for),
    and `media_plane_ingest_driver` (a fuzzer-scripted `IngestSession`
    driving `IngestDriver`'s program/track dispatch). Each ran >=1M
    executions with zero crashes.
  - `tests/label_coverage.rs` (issue #204 drift-guard): every current public
    enum in this crate is either a `thiserror` error or a data-carrying ADT,
    not a decoded external-spec token, so the skip-list is comprehensive and
    documented per-enum; `CachePolicy` (already labelled) is the one
    exception.
  - Two real-fixture examples (`examples/ingest_trunk_playback.rs`,
    `examples/byte_tap_wire_observer.rs`), both reading the shared
    `fixtures/ts/h264_aac.ts` real broadcast capture via `std::fs`, not
    `include_bytes!` or synthetic bytes.
  - `.github/workflows/release-media-plane.yml`: this crate's own release
    lane, modelled on `release-transmux.yml`.
  - `[package.metadata.docs.rs]` now sets `rustdoc-args = ["--cfg",
    "docsrs"]`, and `src/lib.rs`/`#[cfg(feature = "std")]` items gained
    `doc(cfg(...))` pills, so docs.rs shows which API needs `std` instead of
    silently building only the byte layer's docs.
  - Crate-root docs and README corrected to reflect that this crate is now
    functionally complete through step 3e (previously stale text still said
    ingress/egress/retention were "later steps... deliberately absent"), and
    to state plainly that only the byte layer is `no_std` + `alloc` — `Trunk`
    and everything built on it require `std`.
- **`SessionEvent::TracksChanged` — mid-stream track-set changes now reach
  the `Trunk` (issue #781, closing the ingress→`Trunk` half).** A new
  `#[non_exhaustive]`-preserving variant, `TracksChanged { program:
  ProgramId, tracks: Vec<TrackSpec> }`: `tracks` is the **complete
  replacement set**, not a delta (a PMT carries the whole elementary-stream
  list on every version bump, so a full snapshot is idempotent and immune to
  delta-ordering bugs — a consumer diffs against the previous
  `Trunk::tracks()` snapshot itself if it needs to know which track
  appeared). `transmux::DemuxEvent::TrackAdded`/`TrackRemoved`/`TrackUpdated`
  already own the finer-grained, demux-layer shape; this layer deliberately
  does not mirror them.
  - `Trunk` gains a current track set (`Trunk::tracks() -> Arc<[TrackSpec]>`,
    a cheap `Arc` clone) and a monotonic `Trunk::track_generation() -> u64`,
    bumped by exactly one on every write, so a consumer can detect "the track
    set may have changed" by comparing two `u64`s instead of diffing two
    `Vec<TrackSpec>`s.
  - `TrunkWriter::set_tracks(Vec<TrackSpec>)` (new): the write side —
    replaces the set wholesale, bumps `track_generation`, and wakes any
    `Trunk::listen()` registration through the same broad `progress` channel
    `SegmentWriter::publish_part`/`publish_segment` already use.
  - `IngestDriver`'s internal `drain()` now seeds a freshly-minted `Trunk`'s
    track set from `NewProgram`'s own `tracks` field (**previously
    discarded** — the match arm bound it with `..` and a `Trunk`'s track set
    stayed permanently empty) and applies a later `TracksChanged` to the
    already-admitted `Trunk` for that program. A `TracksChanged` for an
    unannounced program is a dropped contract violation, not a panic —
    exactly `SessionEvent::Sample`'s existing "unannounced program" path,
    reused rather than duplicated.
  - Strictly ingress→`Trunk` plumbing: whether/when to admit a newly-appeared
    track into an egress manifest (LL-HLS/DASH rendering) is a separate,
    deliberate decision left to its own issue.
### Fixed
- **A repeat `SessionEvent::NewProgram` no longer strands existing
  subscribers or discards the DVR window.** `IngestDriver::drain()`'s
  `NewProgram` arm called `Trunk::new` unconditionally, so re-announcing an
  already-admitted program replaced that program's entry in the driver's map.
  Because `Trunk` is a cloneable `Arc` handle, nothing errored: every cursor
  already issued to consumers kept reading the **orphaned** `Trunk` the writer
  no longer targets, so the stream silently stopped — far harder to diagnose
  in production than a crash — and whatever the old `Trunk` still buffered
  (samples, segments, parts, and therefore the DVR window) went with it. A
  re-announcement is a restatement of a program's tracks, not a new program,
  so it now defers to the same in-place update path `TracksChanged` uses.
  Covered by a test that asserts continuity from the *subscriber's* side (a
  cursor subscribed before the re-announcement must still receive samples
  published after it) — a track-set assertion alone would not catch it.
- **`max_programs`: bound the number of `Trunk`s `IngestDriver`/`ListenDriver`
  will mint per session** — the fifth unbounded-allocation vector shipped
  from this codebase. `SessionEvent::NewProgram` previously minted a fresh
  `Trunk` (five bounded rings) for every distinct `ProgramId` a session
  reported, with no cap on how many distinct ids one session could report;
  every ring was bounded, but the *count of `Trunk`s* was not, so a malformed
  or hostile multiplex announcing thousands of programs allocated thousands
  of trunks. `IngestDriver::new`/`ListenDriver::new`/`run_dial`/`run_listen`/
  `DialSupervisor::try_dial` now take a `max_programs: NonZeroUsize`,
  enforced in exactly one place (`IngestDriver`'s internal `drain()`),
  mirroring where `max_sessions` is already enforced — structural, not a
  per-`IngestSession`-implementor discipline. The `(max_programs + 1)`th
  program is **refused, not fatal**: it gets no `Trunk` (no `Trunk::new` call
  happens for it at all) and its later `Sample`s are dropped via the
  already-existing "sample for an unannounced program" path, while every
  already-admitted program keeps flowing — refusing was chosen over failing
  the whole session so a 200-program hostile/malformed multiplex cannot take
  down ingest for the programs a real caller asked for. The refusal is
  **reported**, via a new monotonic `IngestDriver::refused_program_count()` /
  `ListenDriver::refused_program_count(id)` counter (never a stored list of
  refused `ProgramId`s, which would just move the same unbounded-growth shape
  from `Trunk`s to a `Vec`) — never a silent drop. `DEFAULT_MAX_PROGRAMS`
  (`64`) is provided as a documented, justified default (real DVB MPTS run
  single-digit to low-tens of programs; ATSC/cable can run higher) rather
  than requiring every caller to invent their own bare literal.
### Breaking
- `Trunk`'s single write handle is split by **ring group**, fixing a design
  hole found while porting real ingest sources: `Trunk::writer()` (one
  `TrunkWriter`, single-take) made it *structurally impossible* for anything
  other than the ingest driver to ever publish a segment or a part, because
  the whole `Trunk` had exactly one writer — so a segmenter (a component
  that needs to *read* samples via a `SampleCursor` and *write* the
  segments/parts it derives from them, at the same time) could not exist.
  The original doc's justification ("a second concurrent writer would
  silently interleave two unrelated publish sequences into one ring") is
  true, but only protects ordering *within a ring* — samples, segments,
  parts, and events live in different rings, so the single-writer rule was
  broader than its own reason.
  - `TrunkWriter` (via `Trunk::writer`, unchanged signature) now covers only
    the **samples + events** ring group: `publish`/`publish_event`. Held by
    the ingest driver, as before.
  - New `SegmentWriter` (via the new `Trunk::segment_writer`, also
    single-take via its own `AtomicBool`) covers the **segments + parts**
    ring group: `publish_segment`/`publish_part`/`note_segment_start`/
    `set_time_anchor` — moved off `TrunkWriter`. Held by whoever owns
    segmentation. `note_segment_start`/`set_time_anchor` are grouped here
    rather than split onto `TrunkWriter` because neither *appends* to the
    event ring (both resolve an already-published `EventAnchor::Segment`/
    `EventAnchor::Utc` entry in place), so this does not create a second
    appender for `TrunkWriter::publish_event`'s ring; `note_segment_start`
    specifically must live wherever segmentation lives, since only the
    segmenter can honestly report a segment's start (the literal B1 fix).
  - Uniqueness is unchanged in kind, only in scope: each ring group still has
    exactly one writer, guarded by the same `compare_exchange` pattern —
    two concurrent *sample* writers remain exactly as impossible as before.
  - The module docs are rewritten to state the invariant as it actually is
    ("one writer per ring group", not "one writer per `Trunk`") and to
    answer, rather than leave implicit, whether the split can let a
    consumer observe a segment before the samples that produced it: it
    cannot, because every ring still lives behind the one `Mutex<TrunkState>`
    this module has always used — splitting the write *handle* did not
    split the *lock* — see `trunk`'s module docs, "One writer per ring
    group, not one writer per `Trunk`".
  - Any caller matching on `TrunkWriter`'s method set (rather than calling
    `Trunk::writer()`/`.publish()`/`.publish_event()` directly) needs to
    take a second handle via the new `Trunk::segment_writer()` for
    `publish_segment`/`publish_part`/`note_segment_start`/`set_time_anchor`.
