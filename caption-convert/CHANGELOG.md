# Changelog — caption-convert

All notable changes to this crate. Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.1] - 2026-08-30

### Fixed
- **#974**: `parse_webvtt` rejected its own `write_segment` output — the
  `X-TIMESTAMP-MAP` header line was misread as a cue identifier. Now
  recognised and skipped during header parsing.
- **#975**: `parse_srt` rejected UTF-8 BOM-prefixed files. BOM is now
  stripped before parsing, matching `parse_webvtt`'s existing behaviour.
- **#976**: `write_srt` emitted self-rejecting output for cues containing
  empty interior lines (`"line1\n\nline3"`). The `\n\n` was interpreted as a
  block delimiter on re-parse. Empty lines within cue text are now skipped.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-11

### Added
- Initial release (issue #931): caption/subtitle format conversion — CEA-608/
  708 and EBU Teletext to WebVTT/SRT, and WebVTT <-> SRT — wrapping the
  extractors `timed-metadata` already implements (issues #568/#666) rather
  than reimplementing cue-boundary handling (roll-up/pop-on/paint-on).
  - `Cea608ToWebVtt`/`Cea708ToWebVtt` (feature `cc-data`, layered on
    `cc-data`'s decode-only 608/708 model) and `TeletextToWebVtt` (feature
    `teletext`, layered on `dvb-vbi`'s carriage-only `TeletextDataField`),
    each with `into_webvtt()`/`into_srt()`.
  - A WebVTT subset reader (`timed-metadata` only writes WebVTT; this crate
    adds the missing parse direction) and a WebVTT <-> SRT pair, making that
    round trip genuine rather than write-only. SRT has no formal
    specification — documented as such rather than citing one that does not
    exist; the de facto ffmpeg/VLC format is implemented.
  - **The conversion matrix is the point of the crate.** `matrix::MATRIX` is
    the single source of truth for all 20 `SourceFormat` x `TargetFormat`
    pairs (pinned by a test asserting the cross-product is complete);
    `matrix::check(from, to)` returns a typed `Error::Unsupported { from, to,
    support, reason }` for any pair this crate does not implement — never
    silent empty output:

    | from \ to           | WebVTT | SRT    | IMSC Text      | IMSC Image     |
    |----------------------|--------|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
    | CEA-608              | Lossy  | Lossy  | Not implemented | Unsupported     |
    | CEA-708              | Lossy  | Lossy  | Not implemented | Unsupported     |
    | Teletext             | Lossy  | Lossy  | Not implemented | Unsupported     |
    | DVB bitmap subtitle  | **Unsupported** | **Unsupported** | **Unsupported** | Not implemented |
    | TTML/IMSC            | Not implemented | Not implemented | Lossless (identity) | Not implemented |

    DVB bitmap -> text is **Unsupported** (permanently out of scope — that
    conversion needs OCR); DVB bitmap -> IMSC Image is **NotImplemented**
    (would need RLE pixel decode, CLUT->RGBA, region/page compositing and a
    PNG/DEFLATE encoder from scratch, since `dvb-subtitle` is deliberately
    carriage-only); TTML/IMSC source conversions are **NotImplemented**,
    outside this cut. All reported here rather than half-built or silently
    dropped.
  - `no_std` + `alloc` (default features add `std`); `cc-data`/`teletext`
    features gate the two extractor backends independently.
  - Fixture-driven tests throughout (`fixtures/cc/cea608_cc1_synthetic.txt`,
    `fixtures/teletext/teletext_subtitle_synthetic.txt`,
    `fixtures/sub/cap.vtt` — all three **synthetic/hand-authored**, see
    `fixtures/PROVENANCE.md`), with mutation coverage: flipping the EOC wire
    bytes drops the expected cue, XORing a Teletext parity bit yields
    U+FFFD, and corrupting the `WEBVTT` signature returns a typed
    `Error::InvalidWebVtt` rather than empty output.
- Not reached, reported rather than implied: the DVB bitmap -> IMSC Image
  pipeline, TTML/IMSC source conversions, and the file/stream service wrapper
  issue #931 also mentions.
- A **real** fixture, `fixtures/sub/sintel-en.srt` -- the official English
  dialogue subtitles for Blender Foundation's *Sintel* (CC BY 3.0; see
  `fixtures/PROVENANCE.md` for the exact Wikimedia Commons source/revision) --
  plus a new `tests/srt_real_fixture.rs` exercising it (real-structure
  assertions, a `write_srt`/`parse_srt` round trip, a lossless SRT<->WebVTT
  conversion, and a timestamp mutation bite).
- Two `cargo-fuzz` targets, `caption_convert_webvtt` and `caption_convert_srt`
  (`fuzz/fuzz_targets/`), asserting the text-format round-trip invariant
  (parse -> write -> re-parse yields an equal `Cue` list) on arbitrary input,
  not just no-panic. Fuzzing them found and fixed four real bugs in the
  `webvtt.rs`/`srt.rs`/`time.rs` parsers:
  - A lone CR (W3C WebVTT SS4's third line-terminator form, alongside LF and
    CRLF) survived as a literal control character embedded in a cue's text
    and then silently vanished on the next write; both parsers now
    normalise all three terminator forms up front (`time::normalize_line_endings`).
  - `parse_srt`'s block-edge `str::trim()` ate a meaningful trailing/leading
    space on a payload's boundary line, not just the blank-line padding it
    was meant for; narrowed to `trim_matches('\n')`.
  - `parse_webvtt`'s block-boundary check (`line.trim().is_empty()`) treated
    any whitespace-only line as the blank line ending a cue, silently
    truncating a cue with a legitimate whitespace-only interior line;
    narrowed to the spec's actual rule, `line.is_empty()`.
  - `parse_timestamp`'s `h*3600+m*60+s` (then `*90` ticks) widening
    multiplication had no overflow check: WebVTT's hour field has no
    digit-count cap, so a validly-parsed huge `u64` hour overflowed it --
    panicking under debug-assertions, silently wrapping to a bogus timestamp
    in release. Now checked arithmetic, returning `Error::InvalidTimestamp`.

### Changed
- MSRV raised to **1.95.0** (issue #949), as a workspace-wide uplift; no
  functional or API change (one `collapsible_if` site adopted a let-chain).
