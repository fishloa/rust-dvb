# Vendored registry data (TSDuck `.names`)

These data files are the **source of truth** for the living value→name registries
that have no fixed vendored ETSI/ISO standard (CA_system_id, private_data_specifier).
They are copied **verbatim** from [TSDuck](https://github.com/tsduck/tsduck) and
compiled into lookup functions at build time by `../../build.rs` (issue #141).
Editing the data + rebuilding updates the lookups; no code changes needed.

**Do not hand-edit the values.** Re-sync by re-copying the upstream file (and
bumping the provenance below). Copying verbatim is deliberate: it removes any
chance of a transcription/codegen mistake inventing a registry value.

## Provenance

| File | Upstream path | Section(s) used |
|---|---|---|
| `tsCAS.names` | `src/libtsduck/dtv/cas/tsCAS.names` | `[CASystemId]` |
| `tsPDS.names` | `src/libtsduck/dtv/dvb/tsPDS.names` | `[PrivateDataSpecifier]` |

- **Source repository:** https://github.com/tsduck/tsduck
- **Commit:** `ab49cf29f239c337170e0ac8d4bf1db5aafe0aa4`
- **Synced:** 2026-06-12

(`tsCAS.names` also carries `[CASFamily]`/`[CASFamilyRange]` sections, which are
TSDuck-internal and unused here — kept only so the file stays byte-verbatim.)
