# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **DASH SCTE-35 inband event signalling** (issue #969). MPD now declares
  `<InbandEventStream schemeIdUri="urn:scte:scte35:2013:bin">`, and served
  fMP4 segments carry serialized `emsg` boxes (after `styp`, before `moof`)
  for segments with resolved SCTE-35 events in the trunk's event ring.
  Non-segment resources and eventless segments pass through unchanged.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-08-14

### Fixed

- **Crate description and README understated the output set.** Both advertised
  `LL-HLS/DASH/LL-DASH` while `OutputKind` has shipped `Smooth`, `TsHls`,
  `Catchup`, `SrtPush`, `RtmpPush`, `RtspPush` and `Custom` for several
  releases; the 0.10.0 release note already listed TS-HLS, so the crates.io
  description was the surface that disagreed. Corrected everywhere the set is
  named (crate description, workspace README, `multimux-cli`'s description and
  README).
### Added
- **`InputSpec::File { path, loop }` — stream a media file as a route input**
  (issue #748). Point a route at a file on disk and it is served through the
  same `supervise_driver` + `advance_route` path as every other source, so the
  existing outputs (LL-HLS, DASH, LL-DASH, TS-HLS) work unchanged:

  ```json
  { "name": "slate",
    "input": { "type": "file", "path": "/media/slate.ts", "loop": true },
    "outputs": ["llhls"] }
  ```

  The container is identified with the new `container-probe` crate over the
  whole file, and the verdict selects the demuxer — including the ISOBMFF
  fragmented/progressive split via `IsobmffLayout`, so no box-walking is
  duplicated here. A format `transmux` cannot demux, and every ambiguous or
  undetermined verdict, fails with its own structured error: **a file is never
  fed to a guessed demuxer.**

  `loop` defaults to `true`. Looping refills from the already-parsed content
  with a per-track PTS offset so the output timeline stays strictly monotonic
  across the loop point. That offset derives from the **presentation-max** PTS
  rather than the decode-order last sample — a track with B-frames reorders, so
  a decode-order basis would step backwards across the loop.

  Samples are paced to wall clock on both the standalone reader and the route
  path, in every `pace` x `loop` combination, including across the loop
  boundary. Unpaced, the route republished the whole file every 10 ms (~300x
  realtime), leaving the playlist's segment cadence meaningless to a player.

  **Known limit:** a long asset holds its parsed samples in memory — the file is
  demuxed in one pass and the sample ring is sized to it. Suited to slates and
  short assets; a long-file path would need incremental demux.

### Note on scope

Issue #748 originally designed a linear-playout **channel** — scheduled
switching between sources, a rebased shared timeline, and SCTE-35 ad-break
signalling. **That was cancelled during implementation** and its code reverted
rather than left half-finished; the complexity was not earning its keep. Only
the file-input capability above shipped. See
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-11-linear-playout-design.md`, marked
`SUPERSEDED`, for what was dropped and why.

(An earlier draft of this entry claimed the cancelled controller's dependency on
`playout-runtime`/`ssai-runtime` would have blocked publishing `multimux`
because neither was on crates.io. That was wrong — both are live at 0.1.0. The
check had queried crates.io without a `User-Agent`, which the API answers with
HTTP 403, and the rejection was misread as absence. The cancellation stands on
its own merits; the claim does not.)

## [0.9.0] - 2026-08-11

### Added
- **Catch-up / time-shift / VOD-from-live serving over the DVR archive**
  (issue #900, follow-up to #746/#903): a new `"catchup"` output
  (`OutputKind::Catchup`) serves `GET /catchup.m3u8` (optionally
  `?window_secs=N` to bound the trailing catch-up window),
  `GET /vod/p{N}.m3u8` (one archived period rendered as a complete,
  `#EXT-X-ENDLIST`/`PLAYLIST-TYPE:VOD` asset once a later period exists on
  disk proving it finished), and `GET /catchup/seg-{seq}.{ext}` (the
  resource route both playlists reference). Requires
  `routes.dvr.enabled: true`; rejected otherwise by `Config::validate`.
  Shares the same output auth (Basic/Digest/Bearer/Forwarded) every other
  output gets — no separate auth path.
  - **The straddle boundary** (the reason this exists): the DVR archive and
    the live `Trunk` are different sources sharing one sequence-number
    space. `catchup.m3u8` merges the archive's segments with only the live
    `Trunk`'s still-unarchived tail (`crate::catchup::merge_segments`),
    producing one continuous, gap-free, duplicate-free playlist across the
    boundary — never two disjoint lists a client has to stitch together.
    A request for an archived segment reads its exact byte range off disk;
    a request for the unarchived tail resolves through the same
    `HlsOrigin` the live outputs already share. No second in-memory cache
    of live data is built — per #746's hard constraint, the archive is
    read fresh from disk per request, and the live tail is read through
    the existing `HlsOrigin` cursor (`HlsOrigin::closed_segments`, new)
    rather than a second one.
  - `crate::dvr::IndexEntry` gained `duration_ns`/`discontinuous` fields
    (`#[serde(default)]`, so an old `pN.idx` still parses) — needed to
    render an archived segment's `#EXTINF`/`#EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY` without
    decoding its media bytes.
  - `hls_runtime::server::HlsOrigin` gained `closed_segments()` (returning
    the new public `hls_runtime::server::ClosedSegment`), reusing its
    existing live-window cursor rather than requiring a caller to open a
    second one on the same `Trunk`.
- **Programme-aligned DVR rolling** (issue #903, follow-up to #746): a DVR
  route can now opt in to rolling its archive period on the DVB EIT
  present/following transition (ETSI EN 300 468 §5.2.4) instead of only on
  the clock, so one recording is one programme rather than an arbitrary
  time slice. `DvrConfig::dvb_service_id` names the service to track;
  `DvrRecorder::feed_si` (fed raw TS bytes by `source::ts_udp`/
  `source::ts_http`/`source::srt` via the new
  `RouteHandle::feed_si_ts`/`ProgramServing::feed_si`) reassembles the
  service's EIT p/f actual section and rolls the period the moment the
  present `event_id` changes. Each period gets a `pN.event.json` sidecar
  (`event_id`, `service_id`, title, announced start/duration) alongside its
  `pN.<ext>`/`pN.idx`, so an operator can find a programme rather than a
  timestamp. The existing `period_duration_secs` clock stays active
  unconditionally as both the fallback (routes/sources with no SI) and the
  hard cap (an EPG whose EIT carousel never signals a transition) — EIT
  alignment only ever shortens a period, never removes the cap.
- **WHEP egress output** (`OutputKind::Whep`, config token `"whep"`, issue
  #743): accepts a viewer's HTTP `POST`ed SDP offer, negotiates ICE +
  DTLS-SRTP, and pushes the route's `Trunk` samples out as SRTP RTP over
  `transmux::RtpPacketiser::packetise_video` (RFC 6184 single-NAL/STAP-A/
  FU-A). A sibling `whep` Cargo feature to `whip` (below) — both pull in
  `webrtc-runtime/media` and share its rustc >= 1.88 floor, kept optional so
  an HTTP-only consumer isn't forced to build the ICE/DTLS-SRTP tree. Scope:
  video (H.264) only, no trickle ICE, no `PATCH`. Verified against a real
  second `RTCPeerConnection` (not a mock peer): 119 decoded H.264 frames,
  `<video>` `currentTime` advancing to ~6.13s, reproduced across two
  independent runs.
- **WHIP ingest** (`InputSpec::Whip`, config token `"whip"`, issues #740/
  #743): an inbound WHIP publisher (RFC 9725) — HTTP `POST`/SDP-offer
  signalling plus `webrtc-runtime`'s `MediaTransport` for ICE + DTLS-SRTP —
  behind a new `whip` feature. Real `avcC` config is captured from the
  in-band STAP-A SPS/PPS (browsers omit it from SDP) rather than fabricated,
  using the same deferred-announce gate `source::rtmp` already uses for
  "wait for the first sample". Video-only (H.264); no RTP/Opus depayloader
  exists anywhere in this workspace, so audio is out of scope rather than
  half-built. Verified against a real browser (headless Chromium, fake video
  device, forced H.264) over a real UDP socket and multimux's own generated
  certificate.
  - **Push egress converged onto the same sans-IO `PushEgress` shape as
    WHIP/WHEP** (issue #942): `PushTransport` gained `encode_media`
    (sans-IO encode) and `write_message` (raw verbatim write, distinct from
    the framing `send`), so `PushTransportEgress<T>` can implement
    `PushEgress` — `send()` encodes and queues, `flush_transmit()` writes.
    RTMP's ad-hoc `is_flv_codec`/`warned_refused_tracks` refusal logic now
    lives in `supports_codec` + `negotiate`/`renegotiate` returning
    `NegotiationOutcome::Refused`; `drive_push` also detects a mid-stream
    track-set change via `Trunk::track_generation` and renegotiates, which
    it previously never handled.

### Changed (BREAKING — issue #903, EIT-boundary DVR rolling)
- `InputSpec::Custom` and `OutputKind::Catchup` are **additive**. Both enums
  were already `#[non_exhaustive]` at the `multimux-v0.8.0` tag
  (`git show multimux-v0.8.0:multimux/src/config.rs`, line 75 —
  `#[non_exhaustive]` immediately above `pub enum InputSpec`; and
  `.../src/output/mod.rs` line 50 for `OutputKind`), so no external
  exhaustive `match` over either compiled at 0.8.0, and none breaks now. Two
  successive pre-release audits recorded one of these as a breaking
  `#[non_exhaustive]` *addition* — both were wrong, in opposite directions.
  This entry replaces them, and would have sent every consumer on a migration
  for a break that never happened.
- **`source::ts_udp::recv_and_feed` now returns `Result<usize>`** (was
  `Result<()>`): the number of bytes read, so a caller can also feed the
  exact same slice to the new `RouteHandle::feed_si_ts` EIT tracker without
  a second read. Source-breaking for any direct caller of this `pub` async
  function.
- **`source::srt::StreamStatus::Fed` and `source::ts_http::StreamStatus::Fed`
  now carry the payload (`Fed(Vec<u8>)`)** (were the unit variant `Fed`),
  for the same reason — feeding `RouteHandle::feed_si_ts` from the drive loop
  without a second read. Both `StreamStatus` enums are `pub`; a direct match
  on either no longer compiles without a binding on `Fed`.

### Changed
- **`broadcast-common` floor raised `9` -> `9.3`.** `output::smooth` calls
  `broadcast_common::hex::hex_encode`, absent at the 9.0.0/9.1.0 tags
  (verified against all three: 9.0.0 -> 0 hits, 9.1.0 -> 0, 9.2.0 -> 1).
  multimux 0.8.0 shipped this understated, so a lock resolving
  broadcast-common 9.0/9.1 fails to build published 0.8.0 today. The API
  reason bounds it at 9.2; the declared floor is 9.3 because the MSRV-1.95
  wave (#949) moved broadcast-common there in the same release.
- **`transmux` floor raised `0.23` -> `0.24`.** `push::rtmp` calls
  `transmux::flv_sequence_header_payloads`/`flv_frame_payloads`, absent at
  transmux-v0.23.0 and present at v0.23.1. Same understated-floor class as
  the broadcast-common entry above, found by the same audit. The API reason
  bounds it at 0.23.1; the declared floor is 0.24, the epoch this release
  builds against (a caret bucket spanning two epochs breaks consumers of
  both lines — #858).
- **`hls-runtime` floor raised `0.5` -> `0.6`.** `src/catchup.rs` uses
  `hls_runtime::server::ClosedSegment`/`HlsOrigin::closed_segments()`, which
  do not exist in published hls-runtime 0.5.0 (verified: 0 hits at the
  hls-runtime-v0.5.0 tag, 7 at HEAD). multimux declared `"0.5"`, so a
  consumer resolving 0.5.0 would fail to compile multimux; hls-runtime's own
  0.5.0 -> 0.6.0 minor (new public API) ships alongside this fix.
- **`broadcast-auth` floor raised `0.2` -> `0.3`.** `config.rs` uses
  `Verifier::signed_url` / `SignedUrlKeySet`, which were added in 0.2.1
  (#747). The `"0.2"` bound admitted 0.2.0, which does not have them, so
  multimux 0.8.0 shipped declaring a requirement weaker than its real one and
  fails to build against any lock that resolves 0.2.0. Hit for real while
  bumping `acap-multimux`, where the lock picked the floor. The API reason
  bounds it at 0.2.1; the declared floor is 0.3, the epoch this release
  builds against.
- MSRV raised to **1.95.0** (issue #949). This removes the workspace's MSRV
  split: `webrtc-runtime`'s optional `media` feature needed rustc 1.88 (via
  `rcgen`), which had grown a dedicated CI job, six `--exclude` lanes and a
  guard script to contain. Adopting let-chains and `is_multiple_of` where the
  1.95 lints require them; no functional or API change.
### Fixed

- **One authenticated `POST /admin/routes` could permanently disable the admin
  API** (requires the `whep` feature). `spawn_route` filtered a route's outputs
  by `!k.is_push()` alone, where the startup path filters
  `!k.is_push() && !k.is_whep()`. A `whep` output therefore reached
  `build_output`, which is `unreachable!()` for it — WHEP egress is driven by a
  raw listen socket, not an `Arc<dyn Output>` — and `validate_standalone` does
  not reject such a route, since it only checks the listen address.

  The panic is not the damage; where it panics is. `add_route` holds
  `self.inner.write()` across `spawn_route`, so the unwind **poisoned the
  registry lock**, and every later admin operation and router rebuild calls
  `.expect("RouteRegistry::inner lock poisoned")`. One request disabled the
  admin API for the remaining lifetime of the process. The `reload` path calls
  `spawn_route` without the lock and so lost only that one request.

  A one-word divergence between two filters that had to agree. The regression
  test asserts the registry is still usable afterwards — poisoning is what it
  destroyed, so a test that only asserted "no panic" would not have caught it.

- **A wrong RTSP password retried forever instead of failing the route**
  (issue #957, found end-to-end against a real Axis camera). `origin::
  supervisor::supervise_driver` treated every ingest failure as transient,
  including `MultimuxError::Auth` (a `401`/`403` that persisted after
  credentials were supplied) — a wrong password is never going to start
  working, so it just produced an endless warn-level reconnect loop. Auth
  failures (and a `404 Not Found` specifically on RTSP DESCRIBE, a wrong
  URL path — also never self-healing) now stop the supervisor outright and
  mark the route `HealthState::Failed`, surfaced by the admin API's route
  status without reading logs. A camera still finishing its boot can
  transiently answer `401` before its auth subsystem is ready, so auth
  failures are tolerated for a bounded number of consecutive attempts
  (`MAX_AUTH_ATTEMPTS_BEFORE_PERMANENT`, 5, chosen against the default
  backoff schedule's ~15.5s cumulative delay by attempt 5) before being
  declared permanent — every other failure kind keeps the existing
  supervised reconnect, unchanged.
- **`catchup::read_archived_bytes` allocated whatever a corrupt `pN.idx`
  sidecar claimed.** `byte_len` comes from a DVR-archive `IndexEntry` in a
  JSON sidecar on disk; `read_exact` caught a truncated container, but
  nothing bounded `byte_len` against the period file's real size *before*
  `vec![0u8; byte_len as usize]` allocated for it — a corrupt-but-JSON-valid
  sidecar (the same power-loss/full-disk class the DVR index-rebuild fix
  above addresses) meant an unbounded allocation. Now bound against
  `File::metadata().len()` (with a `checked_add` guard on `offset + len`
  too) before allocating, returning an error instead.
- **One unauthenticated datagram could tear down a live WHIP ingest.**
  `handle_datagram` returns `Err` on any SRTP authentication failure, and the
  WHIP read loop mapped that to a fatal transport error, reaping the session
  — but the post-handshake media socket accepts datagrams from anyone (no
  source-address/ICE-pair check), so a single garbage datagram in the RFC
  5764 §5.1.2 SRTP band ended an established ingest. Now logged at debug and
  skipped, matching how `output::whep` already handled the identical error;
  a genuine socket-level read error stays fatal.
- **Off-by-four panic in DVR index rebuild on a truncated period file.**
  `rebuild_index` guarded with `mdat_offset + 4 <= data.len()` but then read
  `&data[mdat_offset + 4..mdat_offset + 8]` — eight bytes behind a four-byte
  bound. A period file truncated between a `moof` and the `mdat` four-CC (a
  routine shape after a power loss or full disk mid-write — exactly when
  `rebuild_index` exists to recover) panicked instead of recovering.
- `routes.dvr` was validated (`Route::validate_dvr`) but never actually
  wired into the `RouteHandle` built for a config-driven or admin-API-added
  route — `RouteHandle::with_dvr` was only ever called from this crate's
  own unit tests, so DVR recording configured via `Config`/JSON silently
  never ran. Both `origin::serve_with_registry_impl` and
  `origin::admin::RouteRegistry::spawn_route` now call `.with_dvr(route.dvr.clone())`;
  found while implementing catch-up serving (issue #900), which depends on
  DVR actually recording.
- RTMP push (issue #934) shipped raw MPEG-2 TS as an RTMP `send_video`
  message payload — no RTMP server can decode that; RTMP Audio/Video
  messages carry FLV `AudioTagHeader`+`AACAUDIODATA` /
  `VideoTagHeader`+`AVCVIDEOPACKET` bodies. `PushTransport` gained
  `send_media` (default: mux with `TsMux` and send the blob, what SRT/RTSP
  push both want); `RtmpTransport` overrides it to split each batch into
  FLV-framed payloads (`transmux::flv_frame_payloads`) dispatched through
  `send_video`/`send_audio`, and its `setup` now sends `onMetaData` plus the
  AVC/AAC sequence headers once, before any frame data. Verified against a
  real, independent RTMP server implementation over a real TCP loopback
  connection (`tests/push_rtmp.rs`), not just an inspection of the client's
  own byte construction.
- RTMP push's `app`/`stream_key` were derived wrong from the push URL: `app`
  took the *whole* path and `stream_key` was always empty. An RTMP URL is
  `rtmp://host/app/streamkey` (or `.../app/instance/streamkey`) — the last
  path segment is now the stream key, everything before it the app.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-08-07

### Added
- **Push re-egress outputs** (issue #744): `OutputKind::SrtPush`,
  `OutputKind::RtmpPush`, `OutputKind::RtspPush` for relaying ingested media
  to downstream servers — turns multimux from an HTTP-only origin into a
  relay/gateway.
- `PushFormat` config enum (`Ts`, `Mp4`, `Mkv`) for per-output container
  format selection.
- `ReconnectPolicy` config for exponential-backoff reconnect on push outputs.
- SRT push transport (SRT Caller mode to a remote SRT Listener).
- RTSP push transport (client ANNOUNCE/RECORD to a remote RTSP server).
- RTMP push transport (client connect/createStream/publish to a remote RTMP
  server).
- `RouteHandle::await_first_trunk()` for push tasks to discover program
  availability.
- Supervisor lifecycle: push tasks spawn at route creation, cancel+join on
  route removal.

### Changed
- Requires `rtmp-runtime` 0.5 and `rtsp-runtime` 0.5 (new client-side
  publish APIs used by the push transports).

## [0.7.0] - 2026-08-05

### Added
- **MPTS (multi-programme transport stream) ingest** (issue #906):
  `ProgramTracker` now groups tracks by `TrackSpec::program_number`, producing
  one `ProgramId` per distinct TS programme. Every real DVB-T/S/C multiplex is
  MPTS — this was the sole gap preventing real DVB ingest. Non-TS sources
  (`program_number: None`) continue to collapse into one `ProgramId`.
- Mid-stream track additions (PMT version changes adding an elementary stream)
  now reach the running segmenter (issue #781). Previously, `track_specs` was a
  one-shot snapshot consumed at segmenter construction; a broadcaster adding an
  audio language or subtitle track mid-programme was logged and its samples
  silently dropped. Now `ProgramTracker` maps mid-stream additions to the same
  program, emits `SessionEvent::TracksChanged` with the complete track set, and
  `drive_program_segmenters` detects the `Trunk`'s `track_generation` change to
  admit the new track into the segmenter (or rebuild it, for fMP4) at the next
  segment boundary — with no media-sequence reset and no interruption to
  existing tracks. DASH output explicitly logs and continues serving existing
  tracks (adding a representation mid-stream needs a new `Period`, which is
  tracked for a follow-up).
- **Smooth Streaming output** (`OutputKind::Smooth`, config token `"smooth"`,
  issue #742): a route configured with it serves an MS-SSTR client Manifest
  (`/Manifest`) and fragment responses at the Smooth URL shape
  (`QualityLevels({bitrate})/Fragments({type}={start time})`), sharing the
  same fMP4 segment bytes every other output reads from the `Trunk`.
- **DVR durable segment archive** (issue #746): a per-route `dvr` config block
  with `enabled`, `archive_root`, `retention_periods`/`retention_bytes`,
  `period_duration_secs` (default 3 hours), and `overrun`
  (`"gap"`/`"stall"`/`"terminate"`). Finished segments are appended to a
  **period container file** (`<archive_root>/<route>/pN.<ext>`) — one file
  per period epoch, not one per segment. For fMP4, the init segment is
  written at the head of the file and media fragments follow; the resulting
  file is a valid CMAF track (init + concatenated fragments). For MPEG‑TS,
  segments are natively concatenable 188‑byte packets. A byte-range index
  sidecar (`pN.idx`) maps `(seq, pts, offset, len)` for O(1) lookup (issue
  #900) and is rebuildable by rescanning the period file. A new period is
  rolled on duration expiry or on fMP4 init change (mid-stream track
  addition — issue #781). Retention operates on whole periods, quantised
  to the configured duration. Recording is a `SegmentEgress` implementation
  draining its own pinning `SegmentCursor` — it never holds a lock the
  live-serving path needs and never perturbs live output.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-08-02

### Added
- **Classic MPEG-TS HLS output** (`OutputKind::TsHls`, config token
  `"ts_hls"`, issue #887): a route configured with it is served with whole
  `.ts` media segments (RFC 8216 §3/RFC 8216bis §3.1.1) instead of fMP4,
  self-initialising (no `#EXT-X-MAP`, no init segment) and classic (no
  low-latency parts — `transmux::ts_hls::StreamingTsHlsSegmenter` has no
  partial-segment concept). Container is a **per-route**, not per-output,
  property (`route::RouteHandle::with_container`): `"ts_hls"` is mutually
  exclusive with `"llhls"`/`"dash"`/`"ll_dash"` on the same route, rejected by
  `Config::validate()` at load time (a `media_plane::Trunk` has one segment
  ring per program — a program's samples are segmented into fMP4 *or* TS,
  never both, without a second ring; run two routes against the same source
  if both containers are needed today). See `output::ts_hls` and the
  README's new "Classic MPEG-TS HLS output" section.
- `OutputAuthSpec::SignedUrl` (issue #747): configures
  `broadcast_auth::Verifier::signed_url` as a route's output-auth scheme —
  `{ "scheme": "signed_url", "keys": [{ "kid": "...", "secret": "..." }, ...] }`.
  Multiple `keys` entries let secrets rotate without invalidating URLs signed
  under an older, still-listed key. `validate()` rejects an empty `keys`
  list, an empty `kid`, or a `secret` shorter than
  `broadcast_auth::SignedUrlKeySet::MIN_SECRET_LEN` (32 bytes) at config-load
  time, not per-request.
- **Runtime admin API** (issue #749): add/remove/list routes and reload the
  config file without restarting the origin — restarting previously dropped
  every live viewer on every route, not just the one being changed. Opt-in
  via the new `Config::admin` field (`AdminSpec { bind, auth }`), which binds
  a **separate** listener from the media port and requires auth (`auth` is
  mandatory, not `Option`) — starting the admin API unauthenticated is
  impossible by construction. Endpoints: `GET /admin/routes`,
  `GET /admin/routes/{name}`, `POST /admin/routes` (body: the same `Route`
  config shape, `409` on a duplicate name), `DELETE /admin/routes/{name}`
  (`404` if unknown; drains the removed route's supervisor without
  disturbing any other route), `POST /admin/reload` (re-reads the config
  file and converges added/removed/changed routes — an unchanged route is
  never restarted). See `crate::origin::admin` and the README's new
  "Runtime admin API" section.
- New `origin::serve_config_file`/`serve_config_file_with_registry` entry
  points: load a JSON config from a path and remember it, so
  `POST /admin/reload` has a file to re-read. `multimux-cli --config <FILE>`
  now goes through this path.
- `config::Route`/`InputSpec`/`AuthSpec`/`output::OutputKind` now derive
  `PartialEq` (used by the admin reload diff to detect an unchanged route).
- `error::MultimuxError` gained `RouteExists`/`RouteNotFound` variants (the
  admin API's `409`/`404` mappings).

### Changed
- `source::hls_pull` builds/parses HLS playlists via `broadcast-hls` directly
  instead of reaching through `transmux::hls` for it (issue #878). No public
  API or behaviour change.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-07-30

### Fixed
- Floor `media-plane` to `0.1.1`. The `^0.1` bucket also contains 0.1.0,
  which is built against `transmux` 0.20, so a consumer could resolve two
  `transmux` minors into one graph and hit trait-resolution errors pointing
  at this crate's internals (#858).

## [0.5.1] - 2026-07-30

### Fixed
- Smooth-pull ingest (`source::smooth_pull`) now skips any `StreamType`
  other than `Video`/`Audio` at manifest-parse time (previously only `Text`
  was filtered, so a future `StreamType` variant would have reached an
  exhaustive match and panicked). Surfaced by `transmux`'s `StreamType`
  gaining `#[non_exhaustive]` (issue #806).
- `output::llhls`/`origin::resource` now handle a future `LlHlsBody` variant
  defensively (same status as the existing `Resource`/`Playlist` fallback),
  consistent with `ll-hls-runtime`'s `LlHlsBody` gaining `#[non_exhaustive]`.
- **DASH and LL-DASH manifests returned 503 forever on every driver-backed
  route** (shipped in v0.5.0). `RouteHandle::set_track_specs` had no
  production call site — `report_driver_progress` now syncs track specs
  from each published program's `Trunk` into the route on every poll, using
  `track_generation()` to avoid redundant syncs (issue #831).

### Added
- `tests/label_coverage.rs` drift guard (issue #806).

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-28

### Changed (BREAKING — pre-publish hardening)
- **Five publicly reachable enums in `crate::source` are now
  `#[non_exhaustive]`**: `DashResourceId`, `DashAction` (`source::dash_pull`),
  `HlsFetchId` (`source::hls_pull`), `SmoothResourceId`, `SmoothAction`
  (`source::smooth_pull`). Each answers "which resource am I fetching" or
  "which action next" for a pull protocol, so each is exactly the kind of enum
  that gains a variant as a protocol's surface is covered more fully — and
  adding a variant to a published exhaustive enum is a breaking change.
  Bundled into 0.5.0, which is already breaking, so it costs downstream
  matchers nothing beyond the wildcard arm they need for this release anyway;
  deferring it would have required a further breaking bump later purely to
  attach an attribute.
  - `media-plane` was audited the same way and needed nothing: every public
    enum there already carries it.

### Added (issue #805 task 6: per-program serving state, MPTS-ready)
- **`RouteHandle` gains per-program serving state.** A new crate-private
  `ProgramServing` bundle groups one program's `Trunk`, its
  `LlHlsOrigin`, and its `DashState` together, keyed by `ProgramId` in
  `RouteHandle`'s registry — replacing the single owned `Trunk`/`ll_hls`/
  `dash` triple `RouteHandle::new` used to build eagerly. A `ProgramServing`
  bundle is created the instant (and only the instant)
  `RouteHandle::publish_program` is called for that program, mirroring
  `media_plane::IngestDriver` minting a `Trunk` the instant it observes
  `SessionEvent::NewProgram`. Proven end to end by a new test
  (`route::program_registry_tests::two_programs_serve_distinct_media`): two
  programs on one route now serve genuinely distinct init bytes and segments.
- **`RouteHandle::publish_new_program(program) -> Arc<Trunk>`** (new, `pub`):
  mints a `Trunk` sized like the route's own configured ring capacities and
  publishes it under `program` in one step — the test/plugin-facing
  replacement for the deleted `publish_owned_trunk`, and the only way to get
  a `Trunk` handle back from a `RouteHandle` (it is always already
  registered).
- **`RouteHandle::name()`/`with_name()`** (new, `pub`): a route's own name,
  defaulting to `"unknown"`. `crate::origin::serve_with_registry`'s one
  production route-construction call site now chains `.with_name(route.name)`
  so `crate::source::segment::drive_program_segmenters` (issue #809, below)
  can label its metrics without threading a name parameter through every
  `run_*` call site.
- **`crate::source::{DriverProgress, advance_route}`** (new, `pub`): the one
  facade a driver-backed drive loop (in-tree `run_*`, or an external
  `SchemeRegistry` `Custom` factory) now calls once per iteration, replacing
  the caller-assembled pair `report_driver_progress` +
  `segment::drive_program_segmenters` those two functions used to require
  (both narrowed back to `pub(crate)` — see Changed, below). `DriverProgress`
  is the one opaque per-attempt state value a caller declares and threads
  through; `advance_route` performs both steps, in order, every time — a
  wrong order or a skipped step (the exact footgun the old two-call API
  invited) is no longer possible. `examples/custom_scheme.rs` and
  `tests/dispatch_ingest.rs`'s `Custom`-dispatch coverage are rewritten onto
  this facade.

### Fixed (issue #804)
- **`rtsps://` (RTSP over TLS) ingest works again.** The step-5a port left
  `source::rtsp::run_rtsp` wiring only a plain `TcpStream`, and refusing an
  `rtsps://` URL outright with an error quoting an internal task number — a
  user-visible capability regression against 0.4, on a scheme that is common
  on IP cameras. `run_rtsp` now branches on the URL scheme
  (`RtspDialer::is_tls`, already present and tested) and, for `rtsps://`,
  TCP-connects then performs a real `tokio_rustls` handshake before any RTSP
  is exchanged — trusting the public-CA `webpki-roots` bundle via
  `rtsp_runtime::io::default_tls_client_config`, the same config
  `rtsp_runtime::io::AsyncRtspClient::connect_tls_with` uses. Both transports
  are erased to a boxed `AsyncRead`/`AsyncWrite` pair, so the sans-IO
  `poll_transmit`/`feed` drive loop is written once and never has to know
  which one it got. Gated behind this crate's existing default-on `tls`
  feature; with `--no-default-features`, an `rtsps://` route fails fast with
  an error naming the missing feature.
  - The interim refusal did at least **fail safe** — it never opened a
    plaintext socket to a TLS port — and that property is preserved and now
    *asserted* rather than assumed: a new test points a real `rtsps://` route
    at a deliberately-plain loopback listener and checks the bytes the
    listener actually received begin with a TLS handshake record (`0x16`,
    major version `0x03`), never the ASCII first byte of an RTSP request
    line.
  - **SNI derivation restored.** `sni_server_name` (dropped in the 5a port,
    and *not* relocated — `AsyncRtspClient::connect_tls_with` takes a
    caller-supplied `server_name` and does no bracket-stripping of its own)
    strips brackets from IPv6 literals, since rustls'
    `ServerName::try_from` rejects them: `[2001:db8::1]` -> `2001:db8::1`,
    with hostnames and IPv4 literals passed through unchanged. Without it,
    an `rtsps://` camera addressed by IPv6 literal would fail — and *only*
    that case, which ordinary testing misses. Also exposed as
    `RtspDialer::sni_server_name`.
  - A real TLS handshake is exercised in-tree: a new loopback test runs a
    genuine `tokio_rustls` server (self-signed `CN=localhost` fixture cert,
    shared byte-for-byte with `rtsp-runtime`'s own TLS loopback test) and
    drives a full DESCRIBE -> SETUP -> PLAY -> interleaved-RTP-depayload
    exchange over the encrypted socket, asserting a real depayloaded sample
    lands in the `Trunk`.

### Fixed (issue #809)
- **`multimux_parts_produced_total`/`multimux_segments_produced_total` have
  an emitter again.** These two counters had no emitter at all since the
  media-plane port — they read zero while media flowed perfectly (worse than
  absent) before being deleted outright pending this fix (see the entry
  below). `crate::source::segment::drive_program_segmenters` — the one place
  in the driver-backed architecture that actually turns samples into
  parts/segments — now bumps both, labelled by the new `RouteHandle::name()`
  (see Added, above) rather than threading a route-name parameter through
  nine `run_*` call sites. A new test
  (`source::segment::tests::drive_program_segmenters_bumps_parts_and_segments_produced_counters`)
  asserts both counters actually increment for a driver-backed route.
  Swept the rest of `crate::prometheus` for the same failure mode: `ROUTE_UP`/
  `SOURCE_RECONNECTS_TOTAL` (`origin::supervisor`), `ACTIVE_BLOCKING_REQUESTS`
  (`origin::resource`/`output::llhls`), and `HTTP_REQUESTS_TOTAL`/
  `HTTP_REQUEST_DURATION_SECONDS`/`BYTES_SERVED_TOTAL` (`origin`'s HTTP
  middleware) all still have live emitters — no other casualty found.

### Removed (BREAKING — issue #805 task 6: the placeholder `Trunk` is gone)
- **`RouteHandle`'s owned placeholder `Trunk` field and `publish_owned_trunk`
  are deleted.** `RouteHandle::new` no longer builds any `Trunk`/`LlHlsOrigin`/
  `DashState` at all; every program's serving state lives only in the new
  per-program registry (see Added, above), created only by
  `publish_program`/`publish_new_program`. This makes the **publish-or-hang
  footgun structurally impossible** rather than merely documented against: a
  producer can no longer write into a `Trunk` that egress cannot resolve,
  because there is no `Trunk` to write into until it is published. Callers
  that used to build a route, write via `set_init`/`add_part`/`add_segment`,
  then call `publish_owned_trunk()` now call `publish_new_program(program)`
  **first** (it both mints and publishes), then write.
- **`RouteHandle::set_init`/`init_bytes`/`set_track_specs`/`track_specs`/
  `add_part`/`add_segment`/`window_segments` all take a new leading
  `ProgramId` parameter.** These used to operate on the single owned `Trunk`;
  they now resolve (or, for the writers, silently no-op with a logged
  warning if unpublished) the named program's `ProgramServing` bundle. Every
  in-tree egress call site resolves `crate::route::SPTS_PROGRAM_ID` (the
  SPTS default, unchanged behaviour for every existing route) via the new
  `crate::http::resolve_route_program` (renamed from `resolve_route_trunk`,
  which returned just the `Trunk`; the renamed function returns the whole
  `ProgramServing` bundle so a caller never risks pairing one program's
  `Trunk` with a different program's `LlHlsOrigin`).
- **MPTS addressing is documented, not implemented** (as scoped): with
  per-program serving state in place, a route can genuinely serve several
  programs, but there is still no way for an HTTP request to *select* a
  non-default one. `RouteHandle`'s own module doc records three options (URL
  path segment, query parameter, config-declared per-program route) and
  recommends the query parameter as the additive "MVP" choice, plus a known
  gap: `ProgramResolution::NotYetAnnounced` vs. `NotFound` is derived from
  "the registry is empty", which cannot yet distinguish "this MPTS program
  hasn't been minted yet" from "this program will never exist" for a
  route where at least one *other* program has already landed.

### Fixed (issue #808)
- **Samples published in the SAME `feed` call as `NewProgram` are no longer
  silently dropped.** `ProgramSegmenter::try_new` now subscribes with
  `media_plane::trunk::Trunk::subscribe_from_backlog` instead of `subscribe`:
  the driver's own feed batch that announces a program routinely carries its
  first samples too (a single MPEG-TS feed of 64 packets commonly carries
  the PMT and the first PES packets together), and those samples were
  already sitting in the ring by the time `drive_program_segmenters` built
  the segmenter — a live-tail `subscribe()` cursor never observed them. If
  the dropped batch held the opening IDR, the first segment either started
  on a non-keyframe or was delayed; this was silent (no error, no log).
  `examples/custom_scheme.rs` and `tests/dispatch_ingest.rs` no longer split
  their announce/sample script across two `feed` calls to work around this —
  both now announce and publish in one call, the ordinary shape.

### Removed (BREAKING — issue #805 task 5/6: convergence)
- **`SourceConnector`, `supervise`, and the whole `pipeline` module are
  deleted.** Every input kind now dials/listens over
  `media_plane::ingress`'s `Dialer`/`Listener` + `IngestSession` traits, driven
  by `supervisor::supervise_driver` — RTMP (task 4) was the last holdout, and
  once it moved, `SourceConnector`/`supervise` (and the `pipeline::SampleSource`/
  `run_pipeline`/`MockSource` trio it drove) had no remaining caller.
  - `pub use origin::supervisor::{Backoff, SourceConnector, supervise};` is now
    `pub use origin::supervisor::{Backoff, supervise_driver};` — a downstream
    crate implementing `SourceConnector` or calling `supervise`/
    `multimux::pipeline::*` directly no longer compiles against this crate;
    port onto `supervise_driver` over your own `Dialer`/`IngestSession` (see
    `examples/custom_scheme.rs`, rewritten to demonstrate exactly this).
  - The `testsupport` feature and the `serve_mock` example are removed with
    it: both existed solely to gate `pipeline::MockSource`.
- **`RouteHandle`'s owned `Trunk` field now has no production writer.** It
  stays (removing it forces `ll_hls`/`dash` to be built per-program instead of
  once in `RouteHandle::new`) but is now a pre-first-program **placeholder**,
  driven only by this crate's own `tests/*.rs` (via `set_init`/`add_part`/
  `add_segment` + `publish_owned_trunk`, which stays `pub` for exactly that
  reason). See `RouteHandle`'s own doc. **Superseded by issue #805 task 6,
  below: the placeholder and `publish_owned_trunk` are deleted outright.**
- **`crate::prometheus::{SEGMENTS_PRODUCED_TOTAL, PARTS_PRODUCED_TOTAL}`
  removed** (the two counters became dead code — the deleted `run_pipeline`
  was their only caller; no driver-backed `run_*` path ever bumped them, since
  `crate::source::segment::ProgramSegmenter` has no route name to label them
  with). Restoring `multimux_segments_produced_total`/
  `multimux_parts_produced_total` for the driver-backed architecture is a
  separate, unscoped follow-up (threading a route name through
  `drive_program_segmenters`/`ProgramSegmenter`, touching every `run_*` call
  site) — flagged here rather than silently dropped or hastily wired up
  underneath this task.

### Changed (issue #805 task 5/6: the plugin extension point)
- **`crate::source::report_driver_progress` and
  `crate::source::segment::{ProgramSegmenter, drive_program_segmenters}` are
  now `pub`** (were `pub(crate)`). These are the two per-iteration calls every
  in-tree driver-backed `run_*` makes; with `SourceConnector`/`supervise`
  gone, they are also the *only* way an external `SchemeRegistry`-registered
  `Custom` input factory driving its own `Dialer`/`IngestSession` can publish
  its ingest into `RouteHandle`'s (crate-private) program registry and turn
  its samples into LL-HLS-servable segments/parts — without this, the
  extension point documented in `crate::registry`/`examples/custom_scheme.rs`
  would be unusable for anything beyond a trivial connect-only stub.
  **Superseded by issue #805 task 6, above: narrowed back to `pub(crate)`
  behind the single `crate::source::advance_route` facade.**
- **`examples/custom_scheme.rs` rewritten** to demonstrate the supported
  plugin shape: a small `Dialer`/`IngestSession` pair (`DemoDialer`/
  `DemoSession`, synthetic single-track AVC media) driven by
  `supervise_driver`, publishing through `report_driver_progress` +
  `drive_program_segmenters` exactly like a built-in source. The example now
  actually invokes the registered factory and waits for real init bytes to
  land, rather than only checking registry lookup + config parsing. The
  `"silence"`-tagged scheme is renamed `"demo"` (`examples/custom-scheme.json`
  updated to match) since it now carries real synthetic media, not silence.
- **`examples/serve_mock.rs` deleted** rather than rewritten: its
  demonstration value (drive a synthetic ingest end to end, serve it over a
  real HTTP origin, no camera/ffmpeg needed) is now covered by
  `examples/custom_scheme.rs` (same Dialer/IngestSession/supervise_driver/
  segmenting mechanics) together with `tests/dispatch_ingest.rs`'s real
  end-to-end HTTP tests (`ts_udp`/`ts_http`/`rtmp` dispatch tests already
  serve real — not synthetic — fixture-derived media over real HTTP).
- **`tests/dispatch_ingest.rs`'s `InputSpec::Custom` coverage retargeted onto
  the new plugin shape**: `custom_dispatch_drives_a_driver_backed_source_and_serves_real_media`
  replaces `custom_dispatch_drives_run_pipeline_and_serves_real_media`,
  registering a `Custom` factory that spawns `supervise_driver` over a small
  `IngestSession` fed the real (demuxed, not synthetic) `h264_aac.ts` fixture
  — the dispatch path (`InputSpec::Custom` -> `SchemeRegistry` -> `InputCtx`
  -> factory -> real HTTP `#EXTINF:`) is still fully covered, just through
  the surviving architecture.
- **`tests/origin_llhls.rs`'s first test retargeted** onto a real
  `LlHlsSegmenter` fed directly (mirroring `tests/lldash_dashjs.rs`'s own
  `run_live_producer`) in place of the deleted `run_pipeline`/`MockSource`;
  the file's `#![cfg(feature = "testsupport")]` gate is removed (nothing in
  it needs `MockSource` any more).
- **`multimux::origin::supervisor::supervise_driver` gains direct unit
  test coverage** (`origin::supervisor::tests`): a fake `attempt` closure
  (replacing the deleted `SourceConnector`-based `FlakyConnector`/
  `PacedFlakyConnector` mocks) proves reconnect-after-failure,
  reconnect-after-live-attempt-ends, and shutdown-cancels-mid-backoff —
  properties `supervise`'s own tests used to prove for the now-deleted loop.

### Added (in progress — issue #805, task 1 of 6)
- **`RouteHandle` gained a `ProgramId -> Arc<Trunk>` registry**, the first step
  of converging multimux's two ingest architectures onto one. `publish_program`
  is the ingest-side write; `resolve_program` returns a typed three-case
  `ProgramResolution` — `Found(Arc<Trunk>)`, `NotYetAnnounced`, `NotFound`.
  Held in an `RwLock<HashMap<..>>` because resolution is the hottest read path
  once egress is wired to it (every served request, every viewer) while
  publication is rare and bounded by `IngestDriver`'s `max_programs`.
  - The three cases are deliberately **not** an `Option`: "this route is
    connected but no program has appeared yet" is a wait, whereas "no such
    program" is a 404, and collapsing them would make a still-connecting
    route indistinguishable from a typo in a request path.
  - The registry carries no single-program assumption, so MPTS support (one
    route, N programs, one handle) is an addition rather than a reshaping.
  - Additive only: `RouteHandle` still owns its legacy `trunk` field and
    egress still reads it, so nothing changes behaviourally yet.

### Fixed
- **`pipeline::run_pipeline` published nothing, so every consumer of it hung.**
  Once egress resolved exclusively through the route's program registry
  (task 2), a producer that writes `RouteHandle`'s own `Trunk` without
  indexing it there is served to nobody — and because a request then blocks on
  `ProgramResolution::NotYetAnnounced` waiting for a program that is already
  present, the symptom is an **infinite hang, not a 404**. `run_pipeline` is a
  public entry point and never published. It now calls
  `RouteHandle::publish_owned_trunk()`, matching `origin::supervisor::supervise`.
  - Caught by `ll-hls-runtime`, which dev-depends on this crate and drives
    `RouteHandle` + `LlHlsOutput` directly: its `glass_to_glass` test tripped a
    25 s hang guard and `golden_gate` a 20 s one, both reproducibly, both green
    before task 1/2 landed. An external consumer found this, not our own suite.
  - `RouteHandle::new`'s docs now state the contract and that the failure mode
    is a hang. `new()` deliberately does **not** auto-publish: a bare,
    unpublished route is the genuine driver-route connecting window that the
    four `NotYetAnnounced` → 503 tests assert, and the owned field carrying
    this hazard goes away once every route is driver-backed.
- **The workspace doc gate is green again (26 `error:` lines → 0).** The 5a/5b
  port renamed and deleted types without updating the prose that referenced
  them, leaving dead intra-doc links across twelve files: `RtspSource` (split
  into `RtspDialer` + `RtspIngestSession`), `RtpUdpSource`/`TsUdpSource`/
  `TsHttpSource`/`SrtSource` (renamed to their `*Route` config types), and
  `crate::store::MediaStore`/`HealthState` (that module was deleted outright;
  `HealthState` now lives at `crate::route::HealthState`). Public docs also
  linked to private items (`crate::http::resolve_blocking`,
  `into_response`, `select_representable_track`), which are now plain
  backticked code rather than links — no API was widened to satisfy rustdoc.
  - One correction went beyond relinking: `serve_with_registry`'s docs claimed
    every `InputSpec` variant dispatches through `supervisor::supervise`. Only
    `Rtmp` and `Custom` do. The prose now says so (see issue #805).
### Changed (issue #805 task 2/6 — wire the eight `media_plane`-ported inputs)
- **All nine ingest input kinds now genuinely ingest and serve, via
  `RouteHandle`'s program registry** (task 1 added the registry additively;
  this wires both sides of it). `rtsp`/`rtp`/`ts_udp`/`ts_http`/`srt`/
  `hls_pull`/`dash_pull`/`smooth_pull` were ported onto
  `media_plane::ingress::{Dialer, IngestSession, IngestDriver}` at plan step
  5a but left unreachable from `origin::serve_with_registry` — a combined
  match arm logged an error and spawned a no-op. That stub is deleted.
  - New `origin::supervisor::supervise_driver`: the driver-backed sibling of
    `supervise`, reusing its exact operational shape (`Backoff` between
    attempts, `RouteHandle::health` transitions, `record_route_up`/
    `record_reconnect`, a cancellable shutdown `watch::Receiver<bool>`) for
    the eight input kinds whose `run_*` entry point fuses dial+drive into one
    call rather than exposing a separate `SourceConnector::connect()` step.
  - New `crate::source::report_driver_progress`, called by every
    `run_rtsp`/`run_rtp_udp`/`run_ts_udp`/`run_ts_http`/`srt::drive_socket`/
    `run_hls_pull`/`run_dash_pull`/`run_smooth_pull` from inside its own drive
    loop: flips the route to `Live` the moment its `IngestDriver` establishes,
    and publishes each newly-announced program's driver-minted `Trunk` into
    the route's registry (`RouteHandle::publish_program`). All eight `run_*`/
    `drive_socket` entry points gained a `route_handle: &Arc<RouteHandle>`
    parameter for this (source-breaking for direct callers of those `pub`
    functions).
  - `origin::serve_with_registry`'s per-route ingest wiring moved into a new
    `spawn_ingest` helper, one arm per `InputSpec` variant, so it is
    individually testable without a real HTTP server.
- **Egress now resolves every route through the registry, uniformly** —
  migrated the five `RouteHandle::trunk()` call sites
  (`output::llhls::media_playlist`, `output::dash::manifest`,
  `output::ll_dash::manifest`, `origin::resource::dynamic_file`/`fetch_part`)
  onto a new shared `crate::http::resolve_route_trunk`, which resolves
  `RouteHandle::SPTS_PROGRAM_ID` (the single-program-route default; MPTS
  resolution is task 6) and maps the three-way
  `RouteHandle::ProgramResolution`: `Found` resolves and serves;
  `NotYetAnnounced` (connected, but no program has appeared yet) is a `503`
  "not ready", **not** a `404`; `NotFound` is a genuine `404`. The now-unused
  `RouteHandle::trunk()` accessor was deleted (the owned `Trunk` **field**
  stays — task 5 removes it).
  - So RTMP/`Custom` (the old `SourceConnector`-fed path) keep serving through
    this same migration with no fallback branch in egress:
    `origin::supervisor::supervise` now calls a new, `pub`
    `RouteHandle::publish_owned_trunk()` right after reaching `Live`,
    publishing its own owned `Trunk` into the registry under
    `SPTS_PROGRAM_ID`. `pub` (not `pub(crate)`) because this crate's own
    `tests/*.rs`/examples that drive `crate::pipeline::run_pipeline` directly
    (bypassing `supervise`) call it explicitly to stay resolvable.

### Added (issue #805 task 2b/6 — close the segmenter gap)
- **The eight driver-backed inputs now actually produce segments/parts, not
  just samples.** Task 2 wired ingest (each publishes its driver-minted
  `Trunk` into `RouteHandle`'s registry) and made egress resolve through that
  registry, but nothing turned the raw samples the driver publishes into
  segments/parts — a driver-backed route's LL-HLS/DASH playlists came back
  empty. New `crate::source::segment::ProgramSegmenter` +
  `drive_program_segmenters` close it: one `ProgramSegmenter` per announced
  `ProgramId`, subscribing a `SampleCursor` to that program's driver-minted
  `Trunk`, feeding a `transmux::ll_hls::LlHlsSegmenter`, and publishing the
  resulting parts/segments back into **the same `Trunk`** via its own
  `Trunk::segment_writer()` — never a second `Trunk`, never copying samples
  between trunks (the decision recorded in
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-26-media-plane-architecture.md` §8).
  Segmenting is per-program, so an MPTS route (several programs on one
  `IngestDriver`) segments each independently; only `SPTS_PROGRAM_ID`'s init
  bytes are wired to `RouteHandle`'s single-slot LL-HLS/DASH accessors today
  (MPTS egress resolution is task 6). All eight `run_*`/`drive_socket` entry
  points call `drive_program_segmenters` right alongside
  `report_driver_progress`, and again after `driver.finish()` where the loop
  shape made that easy (`ts_http`/`srt`/`hls_pull`/`dash_pull`/`smooth_pull`/
  `rtsp`), so a cleanly-ending session flushes its trailing partial segment
  instead of dropping it.
  - Killed the two remaining `MOVIE_TIMESCALE = 90_000` magic-number
    hardcodes (`source::ts_program`'s and `source::hls_pull`'s test fixtures)
    and `pipeline::run_pipeline`'s own copy, in favour of
    `transmux::VIDEO_CLOCK_RATE` — matching `source::smooth_pull`'s existing
    convention.
- **`RouteHandle` rebinds its `ll_hls`/`dash` to a driver-minted `Trunk`.**
  `LlHlsOrigin`/`DashState` are bound to one `Trunk` at construction, and
  `RouteHandle::new` builds them from its own placeholder `Trunk` before any
  program is known. `ll_hls`/`dash` are now `RwLock<Arc<..>>`, and
  `publish_program` — for `SPTS_PROGRAM_ID` only — rebuilds them over
  whichever `Trunk` was just published, but **only** if it is a genuinely
  different `Arc` from the one they are currently bound to (`Arc::ptr_eq`
  guard): a same-`Arc` republish (the legacy RTMP/`Custom` path always
  publishes this handle's own `trunk`, already what `ll_hls`/`dash` were
  built from) is a strict no-op, so it never discards init bytes/segments/
  parts a caller already wrote before publishing. New `active_trunk` field
  tracks which `Trunk` is authoritative for `latest_progress()`'s abuse-bound
  check. Without this, `ProgramSegmenter` publishing into the driver's own
  `Trunk` (as decided above) would never be visible to `route.ll_hls()`,
  which stayed bound to the route's own never-written placeholder forever.

### Added (issue #805 task 3/6 — the dispatch-path regression net)
- **Closed the hole that let eight of nine `InputSpec` variants dispatch to a
  no-op stub for a long time while build/clippy/doc and thousands of tests
  all stayed green** (see `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-26-media-plane-architecture.md`
  §8's own account): no test in the suite entered through
  `serve_with_registry`/`spawn_ingest` itself — every source was well-tested
  in isolation (`RtspDialer`/`RtspIngestSession` directly, a hand-built
  `RouteHandle`), but the dispatch that routes to them was tested by nothing.
  - **Layer 1 (exhaustive, cheap):** new
    `origin::tests::every_input_spec_variant_dispatches_to_real_ingest_not_a_stub`
    points every non-`Custom` `InputSpec` variant at a deliberately dead/
    unreachable endpoint (a refused TCP connect, a quiet UDP port, an SRT
    caller dialing nobody, or — for `Rtmp` — a listen port the test has
    already stolen) and asserts `RouteHandle::health` transitions
    `Connecting` -> `Reconnecting`; a stubbed arm would never touch
    `route_handle` at all, so it would still read `Connecting` at the hang
    guard. Exhaustive over the enum via a **compile-time** net: a second,
    independent exhaustive `match` over `InputSpec` (no `_ =>` arm) fails to
    compile the moment a new variant is added without also updating this
    test — stronger than any runtime assertion, and only possible because
    the test lives in-crate (`InputSpec` is `#[non_exhaustive]`, so an
    external `multimux/tests/*.rs` match would be forced to carry a
    wildcard arm that silently swallows a new variant).
  - **Layer 2 (deep, representative):** new `multimux/tests/dispatch_ingest.rs`
    drives real fixture bytes (`fixtures/ts/h264_aac.ts`, a real ffmpeg
    capture — never synthesised bytes) through `serve_with_registry` for
    `InputSpec::TsUdp` (a real UDP socket) and `InputSpec::TsHttp` (a small
    loopback HTTP server), and asserts a real HTTP `GET` of the resulting
    LL-HLS media playlist carries an actual `#EXTINF:` line (not merely the
    `#EXT-X-PART-INF`/`#EXT-X-MAP` headers a zero-segment route still emits)
    plus non-empty init/segment bytes.
  - **`pipeline::run_pipeline` coverage:** the same file's
    `custom_dispatch_drives_run_pipeline_and_serves_real_media` drives
    `run_pipeline` through the exact `InputSpec::Custom` ->
    `SchemeRegistry` -> `InputCtx` -> factory path a real embedding
    application uses, catching a regression of `run_pipeline`'s
    `publish_owned_trunk()` call (see the "Fixed" entry above) the same way
    a real deployment would notice it — every request hanging, not erroring.
  - Every new test is mutation-verified: the exact production stub/removed
    call was restored, the specific assertion/panic confirmed, then
    reverted — see each test's own `MUTATION VERIFIED` doc comment.

### Added (issue #805 task 4/6 — RTMP onto `media_plane::ingress::Listener`)
- **RTMP is off the old `SourceConnector`/`supervise` path** — the last of
  the nine input kinds to move onto `media_plane::ingress`, closing the
  "eight ported, one held back" gap tasks 2/2b/3 deliberately left open (see
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-26-media-plane-architecture.md` §8's
  sequencing note: RTMP was kept on the working old path until every other
  kind, and the registry reconciliation it depends on, was proven).
  - New `media_plane::ingress::ListenDriver::driver`/`driver_mut`/
    `reap_if_terminal` (in `media-plane`, additive): RTMP's `Listener::Session`
    is fed already-parsed-and-replied-to `rtmp_runtime::server::ServerEvent`s
    (`Stage::In<'a> = &'a [ServerEvent]`, not `&'a [u8]` — see
    `source::rtmp`'s module doc for why `AsyncRtmpServer`/`RtmpConnection`
    make that the honest shape), so `ListenDriver::feed`'s `&[u8]`-pinned
    convenience wrapper doesn't fit. These three accessors let a driving loop
    reassemble the same feed -> observe -> reap sequence for any `Stage::In`
    shape.
  - `source::rtmp::RtmpRoute` (replaces `RtmpSource`) implements
    `media_plane::ingress::Listener`: `AsyncRtmpServer::accept()` (blocking-
    async, no `try_accept`) is bridged into `Listener::poll_accept`'s
    non-blocking contract by an accept-pump task, spawned once alongside the
    bind-once listen socket, that loops `accept().await` and sends each
    `RtmpConnection` into a bounded `mpsc` channel; `poll_accept` drains it
    with `try_recv()`.
  - New `source::rtmp::run_rtmp`: a `ListenDriver`-backed loop that admits and
    drives up to `max_sessions` publishers **concurrently** (`FuturesUnordered`
    over one read task per admitted session), fixing a real, previously-only-
    mitigated defect — `supervise` awaited `RtmpSource::connect()`
    *sequentially* against the bind-once listener, so a publisher that
    completed the handshake and then went idle wedged the entire route, never
    accepting another publisher (#738 T11b review, Critical). One stalled
    publisher no longer blocks another (see `second_publisher_is_served_while_first_is_stalled_at_handshake`).
  - Preserved exactly: bind-once/reuse-forever (via `tokio::sync::OnceCell`,
    shared across every `run_rtmp` attempt), `Established` gating on the
    first `DemuxEvent::Sample` rather than the first `TrackAdded` (FLV has no
    `TracksResolved`; leans on `transmux::flv_stream`'s Annex E ordering
    assumption, exactly as `SessionEvent::Established`'s own doc prescribes
    for RTMP), the first sample never being dropped (buffered, then
    re-emitted immediately after the `NewProgram`/`Established` pair), and
    `IngestTimeouts` still bounding every read.
  - RTMP publishes under `SPTS_PROGRAM_ID` (`ProgramId(0)`) like every other
    single-program driver-backed source; MPTS is task 6, out of scope here.
  - Why RTMP *can* implement `Listener` where SRT's listener mode explicitly
    cannot (see `source::srt`'s "Why listener mode is not a `Listener` yet"):
    `AsyncRtmpServer::accept` takes `&self` (shareable via `Arc`, no `Mutex`
    needed) and each accepted connection owns its own `TcpStream` — SRT's
    blockers (a `&mut self` accept, one shared `UdpSocket` across the
    listener and every connection) are specific to `srt-runtime`'s current
    API, not a general objection to a push source using `Listener`.
  - `crate::pipeline`'s `SampleSource for RtmpSession` impl and
    `crate::origin::supervisor`'s `SourceConnector for RtmpSource` impl are
    deleted (RTMP no longer implements either). `SourceConnector`/`supervise`/
    `run_pipeline` themselves are unchanged — `InputSpec::Custom` still uses
    them (task 5 removes them, once `Custom` is the only remaining user).

### Changed (BREAKING, in progress — plan step 5b)
- **Ported the three outputs (LL-HLS, DASH, LL-DASH) and the shared
  init/segment/part resource route onto `media_plane::egress::ServedEgress`
  behind one axum adapter**, and **deleted `crate::store` (`MediaStore`,
  `HealthState`)** — the module was a re-export of `ll_hls_runtime::server`
  types Step 4 replaced with the sans-IO `LlHlsOrigin`/`Trunk` design, and
  multimux has not compiled since. This unblocks the whole workspace: it has
  not built since Step 4 deleted `MediaStore`.
  - New `crate::route::RouteHandle` replaces `MediaStore` as the shared
    per-stream state: a `media_plane::Trunk`, the `LlHlsOrigin` over it
    (serves every output's init/segment/part bytes and LL-HLS's own
    playlist), a small `Trunk`-drained `DashState` (track specs + created-at
    + closed-segment window — the only things no `Trunk` ring holds), and a
    new `crate::route::HealthState` (route up/down; distinct from
    `media_plane::ingress::HealthState`, which is generic over one ingest
    session's own connector error type and cannot give one route's
    homogeneous live/down status). Same public method surface as the deleted
    `MediaStore` (`set_init`/`init_bytes`/`set_track_specs`/`track_specs`/
    `add_part`/`add_segment`/`window_segments`/`health`/`set_health`) so
    `crate::pipeline::run_pipeline`/`crate::origin::supervisor::supervise`
    needed only a type-rename, not a rewrite.
  - New `crate::http` module: the **one** axum adapter every route goes
    through — `resolve_blocking` (the caller-driven blocking-reload wait
    loop `ll_hls_runtime::server`'s own module doc sketches, generalised to
    any `ServedEgress`) and `into_response` (`EgressResponse` -> HTTP
    response, `Await`/`NotFound`/`BadRequest` mapped once, not per output).
    `crate::output::dash`/`crate::output::ll_dash` now implement
    `ServedEgress` too (`Request = ()`, `Body = String`) purely so their
    manifest routes go through the same adapter as LL-HLS, even though
    neither ever answers `Await`.
  - `crate::origin::resource`'s shared `/:file` route now resolves through
    `LlHlsOrigin::resolve` (`LlHlsRequest::Resource`) instead of the deleted
    `MediaStore::resolve_resource`; the issue #721 chunked-transfer
    in-progress-segment path is unchanged in shape, re-fetching parts via
    the same adapter.
  - **Fix #776**: `render_mpd`/`render_ll_dash_mpd` took `specs.remove(0)`
    unconditionally, so a track set whose first elementary stream is an
    opaque `CodecConfig::Data`/`Subtitle` track (teletext, DSM-CC, SCTE-35 —
    routine in a real DVB multiplex) made `DashPackager`/`LlDashPackager`
    reject the `Media` and the whole DASH/LL-DASH route return a
    **permanent 503**. New `crate::output::dash::select_representable_track`
    selects the first track (preferring a video-shaped codec, then any
    other) that actually trial-packages successfully through the real
    `DashPackager` — reusing its codec-support decision rather than
    re-deriving it — so a representable track behind an opaque one is no
    longer starved. Only a track set with genuinely no representable track
    is still a 503.
  - The two RFC 8216bis behaviours that shipped as multimux 0.2.1 (a
    preload-hinted part blocks until produced rather than 404ing) and 0.2.2
    (a just-closed segment's final part still serves) now fall out of the
    `Trunk`'s live-part log for free (segment close deliberately never
    evicts parts — see `media-plane`'s own module doc) — both are asserted
    directly in `crate::origin::resource`'s own tests, not merely assumed to
    still hold.
  - Fixed two pre-existing, unrelated defects the first successful
    `cargo test --workspace`/`cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets` since
    Step 4 surfaced (not caused by this port): `ll-hls-runtime`'s own
    `LlHlsOrigin` test helpers and two of its examples
    (`client_stepping`/`origin_playlist`) called `Trunk::writer()` (the
    samples+events writer) instead of `Trunk::segment_writer()` for
    segment/part publishing — a stale call from before Step 4's
    `SegmentWriter` split that never compiled since; and multimux's
    `AuthSpec::to_credentials` had gone dead (its only call site was the
    per-route ingest wiring Step 5a rounds 2/3 replaced with a
    `tracing::error!` stub for every non-`rtmp` input), now `#[allow(dead_code)]`
    with its reason recorded rather than deleted, since the (tested) logic
    is still exactly what that wiring will need once it lands.
  - **Not fixed, reported**: `multimux/tests/rtsp_ingest.rs` has not
    compiled since Step 5a round 2 ported `crate::source::rtsp` off
    `RtspSource`/`SourceConnector` onto `run_rtsp`/`IngestDriver` — the test
    file was never updated and still imports the deleted `RtspSource` (and
    references a `Sample::flags` field the media-plane step 2c PTS/DTS
    refactor also removed independently). Out of this step's scope (RTSP
    ingest wiring is a later step's job, not the output port); every other
    target in the workspace builds and passes.

### Changed (BREAKING, in progress — plan step 5a, round 3)
- **Ported `hls_pull`, `dash_pull` and `smooth_pull` onto the plane's ingress
  traits**, on the back of `media-plane`'s round-3 `IngestSession` change
  (relaxed `Stage::In` + associated `Request` — see that crate's CHANGELOG
  for the trait diff and the reasoning). Round 2 deliberately did **not**
  port these three because contorting them into the then-current trait would
  have produced a session whose `Stage::feed` is never called; the trait now
  expresses what they actually do, so the port is honest rather than a
  workaround.
  - `HlsPullSource`/`HlsPullSession` → `HlsPullRoute`/`HlsPullDialer`/
    `HlsIngestSession` + `run_hls_pull`. **Now wraps the sans-IO
    `ll_hls_runtime::client::LlHlsClient` directly, not `TokioClient`.**
    `TokioClient` owns its own `reqwest` fetch loop internally, so there was
    nothing for `feed`/`poll_transmit` to drive; `LlHlsClient` is the sans-IO
    core `TokioClient` itself wraps. This module is now the *other* adapter
    over the same engine — all LL-HLS logic (reload scheduling, part/segment
    dedup, fMP4 and issue-#760 classic-TS demux) still lives entirely in
    `ll-hls-runtime`. `Request = ll_hls_runtime::client::Action`;
    `In<'a> = (HlsFetchId, &'a [u8])`, where `HlsFetchId::{Playlist,
    Resource(ResourceId)}` is this module's own correlation identity.
  - `DashPullSource`/`DashPullSession` → `DashPullRoute`/`DashPullDialer`/
    `DashIngestSession` + `run_dash_pull`. `Request = DashAction`;
    `In<'a> = (DashResourceId, &'a [u8])`.
  - `SmoothPullSource`/`SmoothPullSession` → `SmoothPullRoute`/
    `SmoothPullDialer`/`SmoothIngestSession` + `run_smooth_pull`.
    `Request = SmoothAction`; `In<'a> = (SmoothResourceId, &'a [u8])`.
  - **`dash_pull`'s in-read-path sleep is gone.** `maybe_refresh_mpd` buried
    a wall-clock `Instant::elapsed` + `tokio::time::sleep` inside what was
    nominally a "compute the next samples" step — a sans-IO session that
    sleeps internally is not sans-IO. The live-MPD refresh now goes through
    `Stage::next_deadline`/`on_deadline` (an absolute `Timestamp` on the
    driver's clock, exactly like `HandshakePolicy::establish_by`), and
    `run_dash_pull`'s own loop is the only place a clock is read or a sleep
    awaited. `smooth_pull`'s identical `maybe_refresh_manifest` sleep got the
    same treatment.
  - **`dash_pull`'s three pieces of per-Representation state, judged
    individually** (round-2 flagged them as possible `Trunk` duplication;
    all three are kept, with reasons recorded in the module doc):
    - `RepState::init_bytes` — **kept.** Genuinely per-source parsing state:
      the `Trunk` stores decoded `Sample`s, never raw container bytes, so
      there is nothing to duplicate. Re-concatenating the cached init onto
      every `moof`+`mdat` media segment is a structural requirement of DASH's
      own wire format (`Fmp4Demux::unpackage` needs the `moov` in the same
      buffer), not a cache of plane state.
    - `RepState::plan` — **kept.** Fetch *scheduling* state (what to request
      next), a concept the `Trunk` does not have at all — it only ever sees
      samples after they arrive.
    - `RepState::last_number` — **kept.** The high-water mark that stops a
      live-MPD refresh re-enqueueing an already-planned segment number;
      again a fact about *pending fetches*, recorded nowhere else in the
      pipeline.
  - **In-flight fetches are bounded.** New `source::MAX_INFLIGHT_FETCHES`
    (8): a pull session can hand back many `poll_transmit` requests in one
    drain (an LL-HLS playlist reload revealing a dozen available parts at
    once; a manifest refresh extending several Representations' plans
    simultaneously) with nothing in the session capping how many the driver
    launches concurrently. Each `run_*_pull` loop gates every `JoinSet::spawn`
    on that cap and queues the rest — this project has already shipped five
    unbounded-allocation vectors in remote-input-driven code, and an uncapped
    fan-out of open sockets per route is the same class of bug.
    `dash_pull`/`smooth_pull` additionally keep at most one fetch per
    Representation/StreamIndex outstanding (`in_flight`), preserving the
    pre-port per-round pacing.
  - `origin::serve_with_registry`'s `HlsPull`/`DashPull`/`SmoothPull` arms
    join the existing step-5a stub arm (an explicit `tracing::error!`)
    alongside `Rtsp`/`Rtp`/`TsUdp`/`TsHttp`/`Srt`, and their
    `SourceConnector`/`SampleSource` impls are removed. `rtmp` is now the
    only source still on the pre-5a `run_pipeline` path, which is therefore
    still load-bearing for exactly one input kind.
- New `MultimuxError::LlHls` variant wrapping `ll_hls_runtime::client::Error`
  (a malformed playlist, a demux failure, or a resource fed for an id the
  client never requested).

### Changed (BREAKING, in progress — plan step 5a, round 2)
- **Ported `ts_http` and `srt` onto the plane's ingress traits**, and
  **extracted the shared `source::ts_program::TsIngestSession`** — one copy
  of the `StreamingTsDemux` → `SessionEvent` translation (including the B5
  mid-stream `NewProgram` handling), now shared verbatim by `ts_udp`,
  `ts_http` and `srt`. Those three previously carried three near-identical
  ~60-line drain loops that had already drifted.
  - `TsHttpSource`/`TsHttpSession` → `TsHttpRoute`/`TsHttpDialer` +
    `open_stream`/`recv_and_feed`/`run_ts_http`.
  - `SrtSource`/`SrtSession` → `SrtRoute`/`SrtDialer` +
    `connect_caller`/`accept_listener`/`drive_socket`/`run_srt_caller`/
    `run_srt_listener_once`.
  - `ts_http` is the first ported source that produces **both**
    `HealthState::Ended` (a cleanly-finished HTTP body) and
    `HealthState::Failed` (a read stall) — the EOF≠error distinction step 3c
    made producible is now actually produced, and mutation-checked.
  - All 5 of `ts_http`'s Basic/Digest/Bearer/override/wrong-credential auth
    tests are preserved, retargeted at the new API.

### Findings from this round (design-level, not defects)
- **The segmenter gap is CLOSED** by `Trunk::segment_writer()`. Proven, not
  asserted: `source::ts_program`'s
  `a_segmenter_can_hold_a_segment_writer_while_ingest_holds_the_sample_writer`
  drives real muxed TS → `TsIngestSession` → `IngestDriver` (holding the
  `TrunkWriter`) → `SampleCursor` → a real `LlHlsSegmenter` → a
  `SegmentWriter` taken from the **same** `Trunk`, and asserts the segments
  land in `Trunk::last_closed_segment`/`segment_len`. It also asserts
  `trunk.writer().is_none()` so the test cannot silently degrade into "a
  `Trunk` nobody else was writing to". `MOVIE_TIMESCALE` is now a parameter
  of the segmenter component rather than a hardcoded `run_pipeline`
  constant, which is what makes it per-route-configurable at all; **which**
  component owns the segmenter is step 5b's call, since egress consumes
  segments.
- **The pull sources DO need a plane change** — this refutes round 1's
  answer ("a concrete per-source method suffices"). `ll-hls-runtime`
  *already* ships the request-addressing type 3c predicted: `LlHlsClient` is
  a sans-IO engine with `poll() -> Option<Action>`, `on_playlist(&[u8])`,
  `on_resource(ResourceId, &[u8])`, `on_error(Option<ResourceId>)`.
  The blocker is not the *request* side, which `poll_transmit` could be
  widened to carry — it is the **response** side: `Stage::feed(&[u8])` is a
  single, uncorrelated input, while a pull source has N in-flight requests
  whose responses must be routed back **by identity** (`ResourceId`) and
  arrive out of order. There is no honest way to express "these bytes are
  the response to `Part{msn:5,part:2}`" through `feed(&[u8], now)`.
  - **Minimum shape** (recorded, not implemented — it is a `media-plane`
    change with its own blast radius): relax `IngestSession`'s pin of
    `Stage::In` from `&'a [u8]` to the implementor's choice, and add an
    associated request type:
    ```rust
    pub trait IngestSession: for<'a> Stage<Out = SessionEvent> + Send {
        type Request: Send;
        fn poll_transmit(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Request>;
    }
    ```
    Stream sources keep `In<'a> = &'a [u8]`, `Request = Bytes` — no
    behaviour change. A pull source sets `In<'a> = (ResourceId, &'a [u8])`,
    `Request = Action`. `IngestDriver::feed` becomes
    `feed(&mut self, input: S::In<'_>, now)`, which is still fully generic.
    Associated types cannot have defaults on stable, so every implementor
    gains one line (`type Request = Bytes;`).
  - `hls_pull`/`dash_pull`/`smooth_pull` are therefore **deliberately not
    ported**. Contorting them into the current trait would mean a session
    whose `Stage::feed` is never called (all real input arriving through
    out-of-band `on_resource` calls made by the driver), i.e. a type that
    lies about the contract it implements.
  - Separately, `dash_pull` holds three pieces of state a segment store
    would duplicate (`RepState::init_bytes`, re-concatenated onto every
    segment; `plan`; `last_number`) and buries a wall-clock
    `Instant::elapsed` + `tokio::time::sleep` inside its read path
    (`maybe_refresh_mpd`) — a second, independent obstacle to a sans-IO
    port, which wants `next_deadline`/`on_deadline` instead.
- **`rtmp` and `srt`-listener: scoped estimate, not a half-port.**
  - **RTMP is genuinely cheap and worth doing.** `rtmp_runtime::server::ServerSession`
    is *already* exactly the right sans-IO shape:
    `handle_data(&[u8]) -> Result<(Vec<u8>, Vec<ServerEvent>)>` — bytes in,
    (reply bytes, events) out, buffering partial handshakes/chunks
    internally. That maps onto `Stage::feed` + `poll` + `poll_transmit` with
    no new machinery, and `rtmp_runtime::io` is a ~246-line adapter (half
    tests) that would mostly disappear. `AsyncRtmpServer::accept()` is
    `&self` (no `Mutex` needed) and a *pure* TCP accept exchanging zero
    protocol bytes. **Estimate: the session half is ~1 day** (close to a
    transcription of `RtmpConnection::next_events`). **The `Listener` half
    needs one small upstream addition** — a non-blocking
    `AsyncRtmpServer::poll_accept()` (a `TcpListener::poll_accept` wrapper,
    a few lines in `rtmp-runtime`), after which `Listener{max_sessions}` +
    `ListenDriver` fit with no further redesign. Total ≈ 1.5–2 days.
  - **SRT-listener is substantially harder and should be sequenced after a
    `srt-runtime` change.** `SrtListener::accept` is a blocking `.await`
    only (no `poll_accept`/`try_accept`) and takes `&mut self`; more
    fundamentally the listener and *every* accepted connection share one
    `UdpSocket` (`drain_completed` hands each new connection an
    `Arc::clone`), so "accept another while N are live" is a demultiplexing
    responsibility **inside `srt-runtime`**, not something `multimux` can
    arrange. `srt-runtime` does ship a full sans-IO core
    (`CallerHandshake`/`ListenerHandshake`/`arq`/`tsbpd`/`livecc`) but hides
    it behind a private `Driver` task; `SrtSocket` is only a pair of `mpsc`
    channels, so there is **no public "feed a datagram in, get a payload
    out" connection type**. **Estimate: ~3–5 days in `srt-runtime`**
    (expose a sans-IO connection + a pollable listener owning the shared
    socket demux), then ~1 day in `multimux`. Until then `srt`-listener
    keeps today's accept-one-serially semantics via
    `run_srt_listener_once`, which is documented rather than disguised.

### Changed (BREAKING, in progress — plan step 5a)
- **Ported `rtsp`, `rtp_udp`, and `ts_udp` onto `media_plane::ingress`'s
  `Dialer`/`IngestSession`/`IngestDriver`** (plan step 5, "port the 9 ingest
  sources" — `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-26-media-plane-implementation.md`):
  - `RtspSource`/`RtspSession` → `RtspRoute`/`RtspDialer`/`RtspIngestSession`
    + `run_rtsp`. `RtspDialer::dial` performs **no I/O** — it wraps
    `rtsp_runtime::client::ClientSession` (already sans-IO) directly, so the
    whole DESCRIBE→SETUP(×N)→PLAY handshake completes through the ordinary
    `poll_transmit`/`feed` pump, confirming `media_plane::ingress`'s central
    design bet for a protocol with a pre-existing sans-IO engine. `rtsps://`
    (TLS) is not yet wired into `run_rtsp`'s driver loop (scope cut, not a
    design gap — see the module doc).
  - `TsUdpSource`/`TsUdpSession` → `TsUdpRoute`/`TsUdpDialer`/`TsUdpIngestSession`
    + `run_ts_udp`. Fixes issue #774's silent-drop of a `DemuxEvent::TrackAdded`
    declared after the initial PMT resolution: it now mints a **new**
    `ProgramId` (media-plane finding B5) instead of being logged and
    dropped.
  - `RtpUdpSource`/`RtpUdpSession` → `RtpUdpRoute`/`RtpUdpDialer`/`RtpUdpIngestSession`
    + `run_rtp_udp`.
  - All three publish raw samples straight into a `media_plane::Trunk` via
    `IngestDriver`, replacing their own hand-rolled demux-drain loops.
  - **Not yet wired into `origin::serve_with_registry`/`origin::supervisor::supervise`**:
    that loop is built on `MediaStore`/`HealthState`, which plan step 4
    deleted from `ll-hls-runtime` (the crate does not currently build — see
    the 4 `ll_hls_runtime::server::{HealthState,MediaStore,PlaylistOutcome,
    ResourceOutcome,media_playlist_m3u8}` import errors, all pre-existing
    and unrelated to this change) — rewiring these three routes needs step
    5b's `Trunk`-backed replacement, not just a source rename; the affected
    `InputSpec` match arms are stubbed with a clear "not yet wired" log line
    rather than left silently referencing removed types.
  - **Not ported** (superseded by round 2 above, which added `ts_http` and
    `srt`): `rtmp`, `hls_pull`, `dash_pull`, `smooth_pull` remain on the
    pre-5a `SampleSource`/`run_pipeline`/`SourceConnector` path, which stays
    in place (`crate::pipeline`/`crate::origin::supervisor`) for exactly
    those four. See "Findings from this round" for why each is deferred.
  - `crate::pipeline::SampleSource`/`run_pipeline` and
    `crate::origin::supervisor::SourceConnector` are **not** deleted this
    pass (still load-bearing for the six not-yet-ported sources); only the
    three ported sources' `impl`s were removed from them.

### Fixed
- **Cleared this crate's share of the latest-stable clippy canary** (issue
  #770 — the non-blocking `clippy (latest stable)` CI job, which had been
  failing on `main` unnoticed across many merges). Both changes are
  behaviour-preserving; no `#[allow]` was added.
  - `source::rtsp::RtspClient` (a private enum) now boxes **both** its
    `Plain` and `Tls` variants (`clippy::large_enum_variant`). The unboxed
    TLS variant carried rustls connection state at ~1472 bytes against the
    plain client's ~408, so every `RtspClient` — and the `RtspSession`
    embedding it — was sized for TLS even on a plain `rtsp://` connect.
    Boxing only the larger variant merely flips the lint onto the other one,
    so both are boxed and the enum is now pointer-sized. The single
    allocation happens once per connect, never on the per-packet
    `recv_interleaved` path.
  - `source::sdp::parse_sdp_tracks` derives its 1-based `track_id` from the
    media-order iterator instead of a hand-rolled counter
    (`clippy::explicit_counter_loop`). The interleaved `channel` keeps its
    own explicit `saturating_add(CHANNEL_STEP)` stepping — it advances by 2,
    not 1, and the saturating behaviour at the `u8` ceiling is deliberate.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-26

### Added
- **RTMP push ingest input `InputSpec::Rtmp`** (issue #738, via
  `rtmp-runtime`'s sans-IO ingest server + `transmux::StreamingFlvDemux`):
  a route can now accept an inbound RTMP publisher (`ffmpeg`/OBS-class
  encoders) instead of only pulling from a source — `RtmpSource` binds its
  `listen` address once and reuses it across reconnects, accepts a
  publisher, and drives its FLV byte stream through the same
  segmenter/`MediaStore` pipeline every other input uses. Optional `app`/
  `stream_key` gate which publishers are accepted.
- **`HlsPullSource` now ingests classic MPEG-TS-segment HLS** (issue #760,
  via `ll-hls-runtime` 0.1.x's new `LlHlsClient` TS routing): pulling a
  legacy/IPTV origin whose Media Playlist carries no `EXT-X-MAP` (whole
  `.ts` segments, no init resource) now works end to end — `connect()`
  recovers real `TrackSpec`s from the client's synthesized `Output::Init`
  and `next_samples()` yields every real access unit, with no TS-specific
  code needed in this crate at all.
- **DASH-pull ingest input `InputSpec::DashPull`** (issue #758, via
  `transmux`'s hand-rolled MPD parser, `transmux::dash_parse`): a route can
  now pull a remote MPEG-DASH presentation — fetch + parse the MPD, resolve
  each selected Representation's `SegmentTemplate`/`SegmentTimeline`
  init+media segment URLs, and demux the fetched fMP4/CMAF bytes via
  `transmux::Fmp4Demux` (each media segment concatenated onto its
  Representation's cached init bytes, matching `ll-hls-runtime`'s own
  CMAF-part demux pattern), remapping each Representation's local track_id
  to a session-wide unique id. Supports `$Number$`/`$Time$` addressing, fMP4,
  and both static and dynamic (live, MPD-refresh) presentations;
  `SegmentList`/`SegmentBase` addressing is deferred. Every network step is
  bounded by `IngestTimeouts`, so a stalled/unreachable DASH origin cannot
  wedge the route.
- **Smooth-pull ingest input `InputSpec::SmoothPull`** (issue #759, via
  `transmux`'s hand-rolled MS-SSTR client-Manifest parser,
  `transmux::smooth_parse`): a route can now pull a remote Microsoft Smooth
  Streaming presentation — fetch + parse the client Manifest, resolve each
  `StreamIndex`'s fragment-URL template, and demux the fetched fragments via
  `transmux::Fmp4Demux`. Smooth carries no bootstrapping init segment, so
  `SmoothPullSource` synthesizes one per stream from
  `QualityLevel@CodecPrivateData` (`track_spec_from_quality_level` +
  `build_init_segment`), discovering and matching each stream's wire
  `track_id` from its first fragment's `tfhd` (no `moov` to read one from,
  unlike DASH) and remapping it to a session-wide unique id. Supports
  static and dynamic (live, manifest-refresh) presentations. Every network
  step is bounded by `IngestTimeouts`, every expected track is resolved
  before the route starts, and a PlayReady/PIFF sample-encrypted source
  (`<Protection>` manifest element, or CENC/PIFF sample-encryption boxes in
  a fragment) fails with a clear typed `MultimuxError::Encrypted` instead of
  silently demuxing garbage — decrypting Smooth-protected content is out of
  scope.
- **SRT ingest input `InputSpec::Srt`** (issue #739, via `srt-runtime`'s
  real-socket `SrtListener`/`SrtSocket` adapter): a route can now ingest an
  SRT-carried MPEG-2 Transport Stream in either listener mode (binds once
  and accepts inbound Callers, reused across reconnects — like
  `InputSpec::Rtmp`'s push pattern) or caller mode (dials out fresh on every
  reconnect). The track set comes from the stream's own in-band PMT via
  `transmux::StreamingTsDemux`, exactly like `InputSpec::TsUdp`. Encrypted
  SRT is out of scope (no passphrase field).

## [0.3.1] - 2026-07-21

### Changed
- **True chunked-transfer LL-DASH** (issue #721): `LlDashOutput`'s
  `manifest-ll.mpd` now renders a real chunked-CMAF MPD via
  `transmux::LlDashPackager` — a whole-segment `SegmentTemplate` (the same
  `seg-{track}-{seq}.m4s` addressing `manifest.mpd` uses) with a genuinely
  non-zero `availabilityTimeOffset`/`availabilityTimeComplete="false"` —
  replacing the previous discrete-parts-signalling fallback (which
  re-addressed `part-*.m4s` files directly and could only claim an honest
  `availabilityTimeOffset="0"`). The shared origin resource route now serves
  a not-yet-closed segment over **HTTP chunked transfer-encoding**,
  streaming the store's live parts as they land and completing once the
  segment closes; a closed segment is served exactly as before (whole
  bytes, `Content-Length`). Because whole closed segments stay in the
  store's window, `manifest-ll.mpd` now also advertises a real
  `timeShiftBufferDepth`. Validated against a real headless dash.js
  low-latency player (`multimux/tests/lldash_dashjs.rs`, vendored
  `dash.all.min.js` 5.2.0 under `multimux/tests/assets/`): real playback
  advances past 1.8s with measured live latency below the 1s segment
  target, proving genuine chunked (not whole-segment) availability.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-21

### Added
- **External scheme plugin registry** (issue #663): a third-party crate can
  now add a new input, output, or output-auth scheme to the multimux origin
  **without editing multimux**, wired purely via config JSON. Built-ins
  (RTSP/RTP/TS-UDP/TS-HTTP/HLS-pull inputs; LL-HLS/DASH/LL-DASH outputs;
  Basic/Digest/Bearer/Forwarded output-auth) are unchanged — the typed,
  validated fast path. Extension is additive:
  - New `Custom { type_tag, params }` variants on `config::InputSpec` (JSON
    `{ "type": "custom", "type_tag": "...", "params": { ... } }`),
    `output::OutputKind` (JSON `{ "custom": { "type_tag": "...", "params":
    { ... } } }` — not internally tagged like the other two, since the other
    `OutputKind` variants are plain strings), and `config::OutputAuthSpec`
    (JSON `{ "scheme": "custom", "type_tag": "...", "params": { ... } }`).
    `params` is an opaque `serde_json::Value`, always structurally valid at
    `Config::validate` time — the registered factory validates it, at
    route-build time. Every `Custom` variant's hand-written `Debug` shows
    `type_tag` but always redacts `params` as `"<params>"` (it may carry an
    external scheme's credentials).
  - A new `registry::SchemeRegistry` — built by the embedding application,
    never by multimux itself — mapping each `type_tag` to a factory closure
    that builds the real thing from the opaque `params`: `register_input`/
    `register_output`/`register_auth` (and their `input`/`output`/`auth`
    lookups). `InputFactory` closures construct their own concrete
    `SourceConnector` and spawn `supervise` themselves (returning its
    `JoinHandle`) rather than returning a connector — `SourceConnector` is
    not object-safe, so this is how a factory erases the connector type;
    `OutputFactory`/`AuthFactory` return `Arc<dyn output::Output>`/
    `broadcast_auth::Verifier` directly (both already concrete/object-safe).
  - `origin::serve_with_registry(config, registry)` — `origin::serve(config)`
    is now `serve_with_registry(config, SchemeRegistry::new())`. An
    unregistered `Custom` `type_tag` fails route setup with the new
    `MultimuxError::UnknownScheme { kind, tag }` (`kind` is `"input"`,
    `"output"`, or `"auth"`) rather than panicking or silently no-opping.
  - New re-exports at the crate root for external factory authors:
    `SchemeRegistry`, `InputCtx`/`OutputCtx`/`AuthCtx`,
    `InputFactory`/`OutputFactory`/`AuthFactory`, `serve`/
    `serve_with_registry`, `supervise`/`SourceConnector`/`Backoff`,
    `Source`, `MediaStore`, `Output`, and the `broadcast_auth` crate itself
    (so a registered `AuthFactory` can build a `Verifier` without an
    external crate needing its own direct dependency on `broadcast-auth`).
  - New example `examples/custom_scheme.rs`: registers a custom input
    scheme with zero multimux edits.

### Changed (breaking)
- **`output::OutputKind` no longer derives `Copy`/`PartialEq`/`Eq`/`Hash`**
  (only `Debug`/`Clone`/`Deserialize`/`Serialize` remain): its new `Custom`
  variant carries a `serde_json::Value`, which is `Clone` but not `Copy`.
  Compare `OutputKind` values via `.name()` or `matches!` instead of `==`.
  `OutputKind::name()`'s return type changed from `&'static str` to `&str`
  (`Custom` labels itself by its own `type_tag`, borrowed from `self`).

### Added
- **`OutputAuthSpec::Forwarded` — reverse-proxy forwarded-auth output-auth
  scheme** (issue #663 extensibility wave part 1, built on
  `broadcast_auth::Verifier::forwarded`): configures the shared output-auth
  gate to trust a fronting reverse proxy that has already authenticated the
  caller, rather than checking a Basic/Digest/Bearer credential itself.
  JSON: `{ "scheme": "forwarded", "user_header": "X-Forwarded-User",
  "forwarded_for_header": "X-Forwarded-For" }` — both fields optional,
  defaulting to `X-Forwarded-User`/`Some("X-Forwarded-For")`; set
  `forwarded_for_header: null` to disable reading it. A request is allowed
  iff `user_header` is present and non-empty; `forwarded_for_header`, if
  set, is read for tracing/observability only — no trust decision is made
  from it. **Safe ONLY behind a trusted reverse proxy that strips any
  client-supplied copies of both headers before forwarding** — see
  `OutputAuthSpec::Forwarded`'s doc comment. `output_auth_gate` now builds a
  `broadcast_auth::RequestContext` carrying every request header (not just
  `Authorization`) plus the transport peer address (via
  `into_make_service_with_connect_info`, wired in `serve`), so any
  `Verifier` scheme — this one included — can see beyond `Authorization`.
- **`InputSpec`/`AuthSpec`/`OutputAuthSpec`/`output::OutputKind` are now
  `#[non_exhaustive]`** (issue #663 extensibility wave part 1): a future
  ingest transport, client-auth scheme, output-auth scheme, or delivery
  protocol can be added later without it being a breaking change for
  external matches on these types.

### Changed (breaking)
- **`OutputAuthSpec::to_credentials` replaced by
  `OutputAuthSpec::build_verifier(realm)`** (`pub(crate)`, so only affects
  this crate's own `serve`): returns the configured
  `broadcast_auth::Verifier` directly rather than a `Credentials` value —
  needed because `Forwarded` has no `Credentials` mapping at all (no
  username/password/token, no challenge/response round-trip).

### Added
- **Shared output auth** (issue #663 "shared output auth",
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-18-multimux-hub-design.md`): one
  Basic/Digest/Bearer credential can now gate **every** media output route
  (`/{stream}/…` — manifests and init/segment/part bytes alike, across every
  configured route, e.g. 40 cameras under `/camN/index.m3u8`) via a new
  `Config::output_auth` (`config::OutputAuthSpec`, JSON tagged on `scheme`:
  `{ "scheme": "basic"|"digest"|"bearer", ... }`). Independent of, and
  unrelated to, each route's own ingest auth (`config::AuthSpec`/URL
  userinfo) — one output credential guards the whole origin regardless of how
  differently each camera authenticates upstream. Built on the new
  `broadcast_auth::Verifier` (the server-side challenge+verify half,
  promoted out of `testutil`'s test-only mock — see that crate's changelog).
  Missing/wrong credentials get `401` + `WWW-Authenticate` (Basic/Digest
  challenge, or the bare `Bearer` token for Bearer); `output_auth: None` (the
  default) leaves every route open, unchanged from pre-#663 behaviour.
  **Ops endpoints (`/healthz`/`/readyz`/`/metrics`) are never gated** — load
  balancer probes and metrics scraping stay open regardless of
  `output_auth`. CORS/`Cache-Control` headers still apply to a `401`
  response from this gate (needed for a cross-origin browser client to see
  the status/challenge at all, not just a successful response).
- **Configurable `playlist_name`** (issue #663 "configurable
  `playlist_name`"): a new `Config::playlist_name` (default `"media.m3u8"`)
  names the LL-HLS media playlist filename served at
  `/{stream}/{playlist_name}`; `master.m3u8`'s `#EXT-X-STREAM-INF` reference
  follows suit (`output::llhls::LlHlsOutput::new`). Validated non-empty,
  `.m3u8`-suffixed, slash-free, and not `"master.m3u8"` (which would collide
  with the fixed master-playlist route). `master.m3u8`'s own name is not
  configurable; DASH's `manifest.mpd` is unaffected. Breaking (internal):
  `LlHlsOutput` is no longer a unit struct — use `LlHlsOutput::default()` (or
  `OutputKind::build()`) for the pre-existing `/media.m3u8` behaviour, or
  `LlHlsOutput::new(name)`/`OutputKind::build_with_playlist_name(name)` for a
  configured name; `output::llhls::{master_playlist, media_playlist}` are
  narrowed from `pub` to `pub(crate)` (their `State` type changed shape, and
  nothing outside this crate called them directly). Depends on
  `ll_hls_runtime::server::master_playlist_m3u8` now taking the media
  playlist's filename as an argument (see that crate's changelog).
- **RTSP config-auth (`with_auth`) Digest coverage against a real server**
  (the gap flagged in the client-auth story): a new loopback test drives
  `source::rtsp::RtspSource` with config-supplied (not URL-userinfo) Digest
  credentials against a mock server verified by the real
  `broadcast_auth::Verifier`, proving the `with_auth` -> `ClientSession`
  wiring end-to-end (success and wrong-password cases), mirroring
  `rtsp-runtime/tests/io_loopback.rs::digest_auth_over_loopback`.
- **Config-supplied + Bearer credentials, finishing client-side
  multi-scheme auth** (issue #663 — completes the P3c "Shared auth layer"
  story): `InputSpec::Rtsp`/`TsHttp`/`HlsPull` each gained an optional
  `auth` field (`config::AuthSpec` — either `{ username, password }` or
  `{ bearer_token }`), config-parseable via `--config <FILE>`. A Bearer
  token has no URL-userinfo form, so this is the *only* way to supply one;
  when both a config `auth` and URL userinfo are present, config wins
  (`source::http_auth::resolve_credentials`, now used by `RtspSource`,
  `TsHttpSource`, and `HlsPullSource` alike, each via a new
  `with_auth(Option<Credentials>)` builder mirroring `with_timeouts`).
  `AuthSpec`'s `Debug` redacts both `password` and `bearer_token`;
  `Config::validate` rejects an empty `username`/`bearer_token` (an empty
  `password` is accepted — some devices genuinely use one). Every
  pre-existing config still parses unchanged (`#[serde(default)]`).
  - **Digest/Basic/Bearer now proven end-to-end**, not just unit-tested in
    isolation: a new test-only mock auth server (`testutil`, gated
    `#[cfg(test)]`) gates a real axum router behind any of the three
    schemes — Digest verification is a real, independent RFC 7616 §3.4.1
    computation (not a literal-string match), so a client with the wrong
    password genuinely gets rejected. `source::ts_http` and
    `source::hls_pull` each gained Basic/Digest/Bearer/wrong-credentials
    tests driving the real `TsHttpSource`/`HlsPullSource` against it, plus a
    `config_auth_overrides_wrong_url_userinfo` precedence test.
  - No change needed to answer Digest's re-challenge-on-every-request
    concern: `ll_hls_runtime::client::tokio_client::TokioClient` already
    caches its Digest `Authenticator` across requests (from P3c), and
    `TsHttpSource`'s streaming GET only ever makes one request per
    `connect()`, so there was nothing further to cache there.
- **DASH output alongside LL-HLS, from the same shared CMAF segments**
  (issue #663 P4 — `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-18-multimux-hub-design.md`,
  "DASH output"): one ingested stream can now serve LL-HLS *and* MPEG-DASH
  simultaneously, both reading the exact same `MediaStore`-produced
  init/segment bytes (ingest-once, many-outputs — no per-output re-mux).
  - **The multi-output nest collision fix (the load-bearing refactor)**: two
    `Output`s each mounting their own `/:file` catch-all under the same
    `/{stream}` nest previously panicked axum. Fixed by splitting
    responsibilities: the `Output` trait's `router` method is now
    `manifest_routes` — each output contributes *only* its manifest
    route(s) (`master.m3u8`+`media.m3u8` for LL-HLS, `manifest.mpd` for
    DASH) — while the init/segment/part byte serving (`init-*.mp4`/
    `seg-*.m4s`/`part-*.m4s`, protocol-neutral since both outputs are
    fMP4/CMAF) moves to a new shared `origin::resource` route, mounted
    **once per stream** by `origin::router` (merging every output's
    manifest routes with the one shared resource route, then `nest`ing the
    merged router once — instead of nesting per-output). LL-HLS's URLs and
    behaviour (routes, blocking reload, `Cache-Control`/CORS policy) are
    unchanged; the shared `Cache-Control`/CORS middleware (generalized to
    treat `.mpd` the same as `.m3u8`) now lives at the origin level so it
    covers the shared resource route too.
  - `output::dash::DashOutput`: renders a live (`type="dynamic"`) MPD via
    `transmux::dash::DashPackager`, `$Number$`-addressed `SegmentTemplate`
    (not `$Time$`/`SegmentTimeline` — the store's `seg-{track}-{seq}.m4s`
    filenames are sequence-numbered, not time-addressed, so `$Number$` is
    the only mode whose URIs the shared resource route actually resolves),
    with `minimumUpdatePeriod`/`timeShiftBufferDepth`/
    `availabilityStartTime` derived from the store's target duration/window/
    construction time. Single-rendition model matching LL-HLS's own
    `DEFAULT_TRACK_ID` convention: the `Representation`'s `@id` is forced to
    `DEFAULT_TRACK_ID` regardless of the source's own track numbering, so
    `$RepresentationID$` substitution produces the same `init-1.mp4`/
    `seg-1-<N>.m4s` filenames LL-HLS already references. **True chunked-CMAF
    LL-DASH (`transmux::LlDashPackager`/`LlSegmenter`) is not implemented**
    — the store's `part-*.m4s` files are LL-HLS-shaped, not CMAF byte-range
    chunks; P4.2 below ships a signalled-MPD LL-DASH output addressing those
    existing parts instead, with true chunked transfer tracked as P4.3.
  - `ll_hls_runtime::server::MediaStore` gained the accessors a DASH
    renderer needs beyond LL-HLS's own bytes+timing: `set_track_specs`/
    `track_specs` (recorded once by `pipeline::run_pipeline` so DASH can
    build a real RFC 6381 `codecs` string), `window_segments` (a
    protocol-neutral snapshot of the closed-segment window), `created_at`
    (the live presentation's `availabilityStartTime` anchor); the previously
    crate-private `target_duration_secs`/`part_target_ms` accessors are now
    `pub` for the same cross-`Output` reason.
  - Config: `config::Route::outputs: Vec<output::OutputKind>` selects which
    protocol(s) to serve a route as (`"llhls"`/`"dash"`, per-route rather
    than a single global default — different routes may reasonably want
    different output sets), defaulting to LL-HLS only so every existing
    config is unaffected. `Config::validate` rejects an empty `outputs`
    list. `multimux-cli` gained `--outputs llhls,dash` (and the `--dash`
    shorthand for "both") on the single-route quick start.
- **LL-DASH output (low-latency DASH signalling)** (issue #663 P4.2 —
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-18-multimux-hub-design.md`, "LL-DASH"): a
  new `output::ll_dash::LlDashOutput`/`OutputKind::LlDash` (`"ll_dash"`)
  renders `manifest-ll.mpd`, an LL-DASH-**signalled** MPD carrying
  `availabilityTimeOffset`, `<ServiceDescription><Latency target="…"/></ServiceDescription>`
  (ISO/IEC 23009-1 §5.13.2), and a `minimumUpdatePeriod` tuned to the part
  target — served at its own path (not a mode flag on `manifest.mpd`) so a
  route can enable `dash` (DVR) and `ll_dash` (live edge) together.
  - **Scope decision: discrete-parts signalling, not true chunked-transfer
    LL-DASH.** As flagged by P4's own follow-up note, the store's
    `part-*.m4s` files are LL-HLS-shaped (a whole extra fMP4 `moof`+`mdat`
    per part), not CMAF byte-range chunks within one in-progress segment —
    wiring `transmux::LlDashPackager`/`LlSegmenter` for *true* chunked
    delivery needs a second, chunk-shaped segmenter output, a larger lift
    than this story's scope. Instead, `LlDashOutput` re-addresses the
    **existing** parts: its `SegmentTemplate` uses `$Number$` addressing
    with `@duration` = the real part target (not the whole-segment target),
    `startNumber="0"`, and a media template that bakes the in-progress
    segment's sequence number in as literal text (refreshed on every
    fetch — the MPD is always `type="dynamic"`, never cached) around the
    real `$RepresentationID$`/`$Number$` tokens, so a real client's
    substitution produces exactly the `part-{track}-{seq}.{idx}.m4s`
    filenames the shared resource route already serves for `ll_hls`. This
    covers **only the live edge** (no `timeShiftBufferDepth` — an absent
    value is spec-honest "unknown", not a fabricated DVR window this
    origin cannot serve); pair with `dash`'s `manifest.mpd` for seek-back.
    `availabilityTimeOffset` is honestly `"0"`: a part is produced
    atomically (never partially available), so the low-latency win here
    comes from the small nominal segment(=part) duration, not partial
    delivery — reusing `transmux::LlDashPackager`'s `segment − chunk`
    formula would misrepresent that, so this module hand-rolls its own
    small `<ServiceDescription>`/`availabilityTimeOffset` XML injection
    instead. True chunked-transfer CMAF remains tracked as **P4.3**.
  - `ll_hls_runtime::server::MediaStore::latest_progress` (the in-progress
    segment's sequence number + live part count) is now `pub` (was
    `pub(crate)`) for the same cross-`Output` reason as `window_segments`/
    `track_specs` before it.
  - Config: `outputs: ["llhls", "dash", "ll_dash"]` is now accepted;
    `Config::validate`/serde behave the same as any other `OutputKind`
    (unknown tokens rejected, empty `outputs` rejected).
- **Generalized input model + UDP-family ingest** (issue #663 P3a —
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-18-multimux-hub-design.md`, "Input
  adapters"): a route's ingest transport is now a tagged `config::InputSpec`
  (`Rtsp { url }` / `Rtp { addr, sdp, multicast_group }` / `TsUdp { addr,
  multicast_group }`, `#[serde(tag = "type", rename_all = "snake_case")]`),
  replacing the RTSP-only `Route::rtsp_url` field — a **breaking config
  change**: JSON routes now nest under `"input": { "type": "rtsp", "url":
  ... }` instead of a bare `"rtsp_url"` key. `origin::serve` dispatches each
  route to the matching `SourceConnector` with one `match` arm per
  `InputSpec` variant (kept monomorphized, not boxed, since each connector's
  `Source` associated type differs) — reconnect/backoff/health via
  `origin::supervisor::supervise` applies identically to every input kind.
  - `source::rtp_udp::RtpUdpSource` — raw RTP over UDP (uni/multicast, no
    RTSP control plane): binds a `tokio::net::UdpSocket` (+ optional
    multicast join via the new `source::udp::bind_udp` helper shared with
    `TsUdpSource`), parses the configured out-of-band SDP with the *same*
    `source::sdp::parse_sdp_tracks` RTSP already uses (no parallel SDP
    implementation), and depayloads with `transmux::RtpStreamDepacketiser`
    exactly as `source::rtsp::RtspSession` does. Since raw RTP/UDP has no
    RTSP interleaved-channel framing, incoming packets are routed to their
    track by RTP payload type (RFC 3550 §5.1) matched against each SDP
    media's declared payload type — `source::TrackInit` gained a
    `payload_type` field (populated identically for both the RTSP and raw-RTP
    ingest paths, since both share `parse_sdp_tracks`) and
    `source::sdp::load_sdp` loads an SDP body from either inline text or an
    `@path` file reference (re-read on every reconnect).
  - `source::ts_udp::TsUdpSource` — MPEG-2 Transport Stream over UDP
    (uni/multicast): binds the same shared UDP transport, then feeds
    datagrams to `transmux::StreamingTsDemux` (the same streaming demux core
    every other TS consumer in this workspace drives) until the in-band PMT
    resolves every declared track (bounded by a 10 s connect timeout) — the
    TS-over-UDP analogue of RTSP's DESCRIBE step — before the pipeline builds
    its segmenter.
  - No new codec/container parsing in multimux: both sources are transport
    (socket bind + multicast join) plus wiring over transmux's existing
    `RtpStreamDepacketiser`/`StreamingTsDemux`.
  - `Config::validate` now validates every route's `InputSpec` fields (RTSP
    scheme, UDP address parseability, multicast-group IP validity, RTP SDP
    non-empty/parseable) in addition to the existing duplicate-name/timing
    checks.
- **HTTP-based ingest: TS-over-HTTP + HLS-pull** (issue #663 P3c / #717 —
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-18-multimux-hub-design.md`, "Input
  adapters" / "Shared auth layer"): two new `InputSpec` variants,
  `TsHttp { url }` and `HlsPull { url }`, both `http(s)://` URLs that may
  carry `user:pass@` userinfo (redacted in `Debug`, validated for scheme by
  `Config::validate`).
  - `source::ts_http::TsHttpSource` — MPEG-2 Transport Stream over a
    streaming HTTP GET (chunked/progressive `reqwest`, `stream` feature):
    reads response chunks into `transmux::StreamingTsDemux` until the
    in-band PMT resolves every declared track (mirrors `TsUdpSource`'s own
    connect-time PMT wait, bounded the same 10 s). Unlike UDP, the HTTP body
    stream *does* end — `next_samples` returns `Ok(None)` on end-of-stream,
    so `origin::supervisor::supervise` reconnects exactly as for any other
    source's EOF.
  - `source::hls_pull::HlsPullSource` — wraps
    `ll_hls_runtime::client::tokio_client::TokioClient` (the sans-IO LL-HLS
    playback client engine, driven over real HTTP) as a `SourceConnector`/
    `SampleSource`: `connect()` drives the client until its first
    `Output::Init`, recovering the pulled stream's `TrackSpec`s by feeding
    those init bytes through `transmux::Fmp4Demux` once (the *same* demuxer
    the client itself already uses internally — no hand-rolled `moov`
    parse); `next_samples()` relays `Output::Samples` straight through. No
    re-demuxing: the client's own `Fmp4Demux`-based decode is reused
    verbatim.
  - `source::http_auth` — shared auth glue for both HTTP sources: reqwest
    answers Basic/Bearer natively, but not Digest (RFC 7616), so
    `authenticated_get` sends once and, on a `401`, answers the
    `WWW-Authenticate` challenge via the new `broadcast-auth` crate (issue
    #663 P3b) before resending — the same shared `Credentials`/
    `Authenticator` model `rtsp-runtime` already uses. Credentials come from
    the ingest URL's userinfo (mirrors `source::rtsp`'s own handling,
    generalized to any URL).
  - `ll-hls-runtime`'s `client::tokio_client::TokioClient` was itself
    upgraded in lockstep to authenticate via `broadcast-auth` (Basic/Digest/
    Bearer, replacing its previous ad hoc Basic/Bearer-only `Auth` enum) —
    see `ll-hls-runtime`'s own changelog — so `HlsPullSource` gets Digest
    support for free rather than multimux re-implementing the challenge/
    response for the pull path.
  - No new codec/container parsing in multimux: `ts_http` is transport
    (streaming GET) plus `StreamingTsDemux`; `hls_pull` is a thin wrapper
    over `ll-hls-runtime`'s existing client engine + `Fmp4Demux`.

### Security
- **HTTP resource limits on the origin listener** (issue #663 P5, audit-
  concurrency #3): a new `origin::HttpLimits` (`request_timeout`,
  `max_concurrent_requests`, `max_request_body_bytes`) is applied to every
  route via `tower_http::timeout::TimeoutLayer` (default 10 s — comfortably
  above the 5 s LL-HLS blocking-reload cap, so an ordinary long-poll request
  is unaffected), `tower::limit::ConcurrencyLimitLayer` (default 4096), and
  `tower_http::limit::RequestBodyLimitLayer` (default 16 KiB — no legitimate
  request here carries a body). Configurable via the new
  `Config::request_timeout_secs`/`max_concurrent_requests`/
  `max_request_body_bytes`; `Config::validate` rejects a
  `request_timeout_secs` at or below the 5 s blocking-reload cap (it would
  cut off a legitimate blocking reload before the LL-HLS engine's own
  timeout ever gets to resolve or fall back). Defaults preserve every
  existing config/deployment's behaviour.
- **Configurable ingest connect/read timeouts** (issue #663 P5, audit-ingest
  #3): a new `source::IngestTimeouts { connect, read }` (default 10 s
  connect / 30 s read) is now threaded through every ingest source
  (`RtspSource`/`TsUdpSource`/`RtpUdpSource`/`TsHttpSource`/`HlsPullSource`,
  each via a `with_timeouts` builder), bounding both the initial
  connect/handshake step and every subsequent read so a source that never
  responds — or stops responding — surfaces a recoverable error for
  `origin::supervisor::supervise` to reconnect on, rather than hanging a
  route's ingest task forever. Configurable via the new
  `Config::ingest_connect_timeout_secs`/`ingest_read_timeout_secs` (applied
  uniformly to every route); `Config::validate` rejects a non-positive
  value. Defaults preserve every existing config's behaviour.
- **UDP ingest read-timeout** (issue #663 P5.2, audit-ingest #3):
  `source::rtp_udp::RtpUdpSource`/`source::ts_udp::TsUdpSource`'s
  `next_samples()` previously called `UdpSocket::recv` with no timeout — a
  source that stopped sending (dropped multicast feed, wedged encoder) left
  the read pending forever, so `origin::supervisor::supervise` never saw an
  error to reconnect on. Both sessions' per-datagram `recv` is now wrapped in
  `tokio::time::timeout(self.read_timeout, …)`; on expiry `next_samples()`
  returns the same recoverable `MultimuxError::Connect` the supervisor
  already reconnects on for every other read error. `RtpUdpSource` gained
  the `timeouts: IngestTimeouts` field + `with_timeouts` builder it was
  previously missing (mirroring `TsUdpSource`/`RtspSource`); no config or
  behaviour change for a healthy source (default read timeout unchanged at
  30 s).
  - **Deferred (documented, not implemented this pass)**: RTCP Sender
    Report -> wall-clock A/V sync (issue #663 P5.2, audit-ingest #9/#10) —
    `source::rtsp::route_channel` (the interleaved RTCP channel) and
    `source::rtp_udp::RtpUdpSource::connect` (the RTCP companion UDP port)
    each still discard/never bind RTCP; both carry a
    `// TODO(P5.3): RTCP SR wallclock A/V sync` at the exact drop point.
    Judged too large a lift to land safely alongside the bounded-buffer and
    read-timeout hardening above (it would mean redesigning
    `transmux::rtp_stream`'s per-track timing/rebase model, not just this
    crate) — raw per-track RTP-timestamp rebasing is unchanged.

### Changed
- **LL-HLS origin engine moved to `ll-hls-runtime::server`** (issue
  #663/#717 Stage 2 —
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-18-multimux-hub-design.md`, "ll-hls-runtime
  — client + server in one crate"): `multimux` is now a thin tokio+axum
  adapter over the sans-IO engine, mirroring how it already wraps
  `rtsp-runtime` on the input side. Behaviour-preserving — every existing
  test still passes, same served bytes/URLs/timing:
  - `store::MediaStore`/`store::HealthState` are now re-exports of
    `ll_hls_runtime::server::{MediaStore, HealthState}` (the rolling window,
    the part-404-boundary fix, and health tracking moved there verbatim);
    `crate::store::...` call sites are unaffected.
  - `output::llhls` no longer renders playlists or decides blocking-reload/
    part-availability outcomes itself — it calls
    `MediaStore::resolve_playlist`/`resolve_resource` and drives the actual
    bounded `.await` (the one thing the sans-IO engine can't do): on
    `WouldBlock`, it registers `MediaStore::listen()` before re-resolving (no
    missed-wakeup race), then awaits the listener under its own
    `tokio::time::timeout` (still the 5 s `BLOCKING_RELOAD_TIMEOUT`). The
    reentrant-lock deadlock fix in playlist rendering is preserved (now in
    `ll_hls_runtime::server::media_playlist_m3u8`).
  - New dependency: `ll-hls-runtime` (path + version, `std` feature).

### Added
- **Supervised route lifecycle** (issue #663, P0.2+P0.3+P0.4): each route's
  ingest task is now driven by `origin::supervisor::supervise`, which
  reconnects with capped exponential backoff (`origin::supervisor::Backoff`,
  default 500ms min / 30s max / factor 2.0) on connect failure, pipeline
  error, *or* source end-of-stream, instead of the old one-shot task that
  died for good on the first failure (leaving the HTTP origin serving a
  frozen last playlist as `200 OK` forever). The connect step is abstracted
  behind `origin::supervisor::SourceConnector` (implemented for
  `source::rtsp::RtspSource`) so reconnect is testable without a real RTSP
  server. A route never gives up permanently by default — sources like
  cameras come back.
- **Store health** (`store::MediaStore::{health, set_health}` /
  `store::HealthState`): each route's `MediaStore` now tracks
  `Connecting`/`Live`/`Reconnecting`/`Failed`, set by the supervisor at each
  connect/pipeline transition; a state change bumps the store's existing
  progress watch so a blocked reader (e.g. an LL-HLS long-poll reload) wakes
  on a health transition too, not just new media.
- **Graceful shutdown**: `origin::serve` now installs a shutdown signal
  (Ctrl-C, plus `SIGTERM` on unix) that both drains in-flight HTTP requests
  via `axum::serve(..).with_graceful_shutdown(..)` and breaks every route's
  supervise loop; `serve` joins each supervisor task (aborting one that
  doesn't return within a short grace period) before returning `Ok(())`,
  rather than leaving ingest tasks running detached past shutdown.
- **Structured errors + secret redaction + tracing** (issue #663, P1a):
  - `error::MultimuxError` replaces the stringly `Config(String)`/
    `Source(String)` variants with field-carrying `thiserror` variants
    (`ConfigRead`/`ConfigParse`/`ConfigInvalid`/`Connect`/`Protocol`/`Sdp`/
    `Auth`/`Depay`, plus the existing `Transmux`/`Io`), so callers can match
    on failure *kind* instead of parsing a string, following the
    `rtsp-runtime` convention.
  - **Secret redaction**: an RTSP source URL's `user:pass@` userinfo can no
    longer leak into an error message, `Debug` output, or a log line.
    `config::Route` and `source::rtsp::RtspSource` now have manual `Debug`
    impls that redact `rtsp_url`/`url` to `***@host`; every connect-time
    error path (bad URL parse, connect/TLS/SNI failure, userinfo-stripping
    failure) redacts or uses the already userinfo-stripped URL rather than
    the raw credentialed one.
  - `tracing` throughout: `origin::supervisor::supervise` is
    `#[tracing::instrument]`ed per route (connect/live `info!`, disconnect/
    reconnect `warn!` with backoff delay + attempt count, health
    transitions logged) and `origin::serve` logs startup/shutdown/aborted
    supervisor tasks, replacing the ingest supervisor's `eprintln!`s. The
    library only emits events — `multimux-cli` owns subscriber init
    (`tracing-subscriber` `fmt` + `EnvFilter`, `RUST_LOG`-overridable,
    default `info`); the CLI's own top-level fatal-error report stays a
    plain `eprintln!` so it's never swallowed by a log filter.
- **Prometheus metrics + health/readiness endpoints** (issue #663, P1c):
  - New `prometheus` module: installs a single process-wide
    `metrics-exporter-prometheus` recorder (idempotent — safe to call from
    every `AppState::new`, including many tests sharing one process) and
    renders its snapshot for `GET /metrics`.
  - Metrics recorded throughout the crate via the `metrics` facade:
    `multimux_route_up` (gauge, `route`; mirrors `HealthState` — 1.0 while
    `Live`), `multimux_source_reconnects_total` (counter, `route`; bumped by
    `origin::supervisor::supervise` on each `Reconnecting` transition),
    `multimux_segments_produced_total`/`multimux_parts_produced_total`
    (counters, `route`; bumped in `pipeline::run_pipeline`, which now takes a
    `route: &str` parameter for this label),
    `multimux_active_blocking_requests` (gauge; inc/dec around
    `output::llhls`'s blocking `wait_for_progress`/`wait_for_part` waits via
    an RAII guard), and `multimux_http_requests_total`/
    `multimux_http_request_duration_seconds`/`multimux_bytes_served_total`
    (labels `route`, `path`, and `status` for the requests counter; recorded
    by a new `origin::router` global middleware layer for every request,
    root endpoints included). Cardinality is bounded on purpose: `route` is a
    configured stream name or `"unknown"`, `path` is one of a small fixed set
    of kinds (`playlist`/`segment`/`part`/`init`/`metrics`/`health`/`other`).
  - `GET /healthz` (liveness, always 200) and `GET /readyz` (readiness: 200
    once at least one configured route is `Live`, 503 otherwise) mounted at
    the origin root alongside `/metrics`, above the per-stream `/{stream}/`
    nests.
  - `origin::AppState` gained a `metrics_handle` field and an `AppState::new`
    constructor (replacing the old bare struct literal at every call site).

### Fixed
- **LL-HLS spec-conformance** (issue #663, P2 — RFC 8216bis):
  - `#EXT-X-TARGETDURATION` is now `round(max(configured target, max actual
    segment duration ever seen))`, not `ceil(configured target)`. The
    segmenter cuts on the next keyframe *after* the configured target, so a
    real segment routinely runs longer than the configured value — advertising
    the configured target alone under-declared TARGETDURATION and violated RFC
    8216bis §4.4.3.1 (a MUST: every Media Segment's rounded EXTINF ≤
    TARGETDURATION). `store::MediaStore` now tracks a lifetime
    `max_segment_duration` (never reset on window eviction) that the LL-HLS
    renderer folds into the tag.
  - Blocking-reload `_HLS_msn` semantics (§6.2.5.2): a bare `_HLS_msn` (no
    `_HLS_part`) now waits until segment `msn` is a fully-present **closed**
    Media Segment, rather than resolving as soon as the segment merely *opens*
    with one live part (the old `unwrap_or(0)` conflated it with
    `_HLS_part=0`). `_HLS_msn`+`_HLS_part` keeps the existing part-count
    semantics.
  - `_HLS_msn`/`_HLS_part` abuse bounds (§6.2.5.2): `_HLS_part` without
    `_HLS_msn`, or an `_HLS_msn` more than a small bound beyond the current
    live edge, is now rejected promptly with `400 Bad Request` instead of
    always blocking to the 5 s timeout and returning `200`.
  - `Cache-Control` + permissive CORS on every origin response: immutable
    `max-age=31536000, immutable` on init/segment/part byte ranges, `no-cache`
    on playlists, and `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` (+ methods/headers, with
    an `OPTIONS` preflight handler) on everything — browser LL-HLS players
    (hls.js) are commonly on a different origin than the API.
  - **`GET /media.m3u8` deadlocked on every request** (found by
    `ll-hls-client`'s issue #717 slice 5 acceptance test, the first thing in
    the workspace to ever drive this endpoint over a real HTTP round trip
    rather than calling `output::llhls::media_playlist_m3u8` directly):
    `media_playlist_m3u8` called `store::MediaStore::with_segments_and_parts`
    (which locks `MediaStore`'s internal `std::sync::Mutex`) and, from
    *inside* that closure, called `store.max_segment_duration()` — which
    locks the same, non-reentrant mutex again. Every request to `/media.m3u8`
    (blocking or not, empty store or not) self-deadlocked the handling task
    forever. `target_duration_secs()`/`max_segment_duration()` are now read
    *before* taking the `with_segments_and_parts` lock.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-07-18

### Fixed
- **LL-HLS preload-hint parts no longer 404 at every segment boundary.** The
  segmenter emits a segment's *final* part and closes the segment in the same
  step; `add_segment` then evicted that segment's parts from `live_parts`
  immediately — so the final part (exactly the one the `#EXT-X-PRELOAD-HINT`
  points at) existed for only microseconds, and the in-flight blocking part
  request that raced the close still 404'd. 0.2.1 made not-yet-produced parts
  *block*; this makes the just-produced final part *survive*: `add_segment` now
  moves a closed segment's parts into a bounded `recent_parts` buffer that
  `part_bytes` also checks, so the hinted final part is served (HTTP 200) after
  its segment closes instead of 404ing. Eliminates the per-segment 404 spam +
  the boundary latency bump. Bounded oldest-first like `live_parts`; closed
  parts are still not rendered in the playlist (the whole segment is).

### Fixed
- **LL-HLS preload-hint parts no longer 404.** A request for a Partial Segment
  the media playlist promised via `#EXT-X-PRELOAD-HINT` but that the origin had
  not produced yet returned `404` immediately, instead of holding the request
  open until the part became available (RFC 8216bis §6.2.2 / §6.3.1 blocking
  Partial-Segment delivery). Every low-latency client (hls.js, Safari native)
  therefore hammered the hinted part with 404s until it happened to exist,
  spamming errors and forcing a fall back to full-segment loads — defeating the
  low-latency path. The part byte handler now blocks (reusing the same progress
  watch as the blocking playlist reload) until the part is produced, or returns
  `404` *promptly* once its segment closes without it (a real segment boundary)
  or the blocking timeout elapses. Observed against a live on-camera stream.

### Breaking
- The bundled `multimux` **binary** (the RTSP→LL-HLS CLI) moved to a new
  dedicated crate, **`multimux-cli`**. `multimux` is now a **library only**
  (its `serve`/`config`/`origin`/`pipeline`/`source`/`store` API is unchanged).
  `cargo install multimux-cli` provides the `multimux` binary as before. The
  `cli` cargo feature (and the `clap` dependency) were removed from `multimux`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-15
### Added
First release (issue #663): a live RTSP → LL-HLS just-in-time repackaging HTTP
origin — a thin client + server wrap around `rtsp-runtime` (RTSP pull) and
`transmux` (RTP depayload + LL-HLS CMAF segmentation).

- **Config** (`config::Config`/`Route`): CLI-first, with an optional JSON
  config file for multiple routes; `bind`, `target_duration_secs`,
  `part_target_ms`, `window_segments`, and `routes: [{ name, rtsp_url }]`;
  `Config::validate()` rejects empty route sets, duplicate stream names, and
  nonsensical timing/window values.
- **RTSP ingest** (`source::rtsp::RtspSource`/`RtspSession`): DESCRIBE → SETUP
  (interleaved TCP, one media per SETUP) → PLAY over
  `rtsp_runtime::io::AsyncRtspClient`; SDP → per-track `CodecConfig` via
  `transmux`'s SDP-fmtp helpers; interleaved RTP routed per channel into
  `transmux::RtpStreamDepacketizer`, yielding timed `Sample`s.
- **Per-route pipeline** (`pipeline::run_pipeline`): drives a `SampleSource`
  (real `RtspSession` or, for tests/examples, `MockSource`) through a
  `transmux::ll_hls::LlHlsSegmenter`, publishing every init segment, ready
  part, and ready segment into a `StreamStore`; flushes the buffered tail at
  end-of-stream.
- **`StreamStore`** (`store::StreamStore`): per-stream in-RAM rolling window
  (init segment + a bounded `VecDeque` of closed segments + the in-progress
  segment's live parts), oldest segment evicted on roll; a
  `tokio::sync::watch` bumped on every new part/segment drives blocking
  playlist reload; renders the LL-HLS media playlist per RFC 8216bis
  (`#EXT-X-PART-INF`/`#EXT-X-SERVER-CONTROL`/`#EXT-X-PART`/
  `#EXT-X-PRELOAD-HINT`), never advertising an `#EXTINF`/URI for an
  unclosed segment (§4.4.4.9).
- **HTTP origin** (`origin::{router, serve}`, axum): `master.m3u8`,
  `media.m3u8` (blocking reload on `_HLS_msn`/`_HLS_part`, RFC 8216bis
  §6.2.5.2, bounded so a stalled source can't hang a request forever), and a
  catch-all serving the dynamic `init-*.mp4`/`seg-*.m4s`/`part-*.m4s`
  filenames the playlist emits. `origin::serve(config)` wires one
  `StreamStore` + one spawned RTSP pipeline task per configured route, then
  binds and serves — a single bad/unreachable source logs to stderr and ends
  only that route's task, never the server.
- **CLI binary** (`multimux`, `cli` feature, on by default): `--config <FILE>`
  or the single-route quick start `--rtsp <URL> --name <NAME>`, plus
  `--bind`/`--target-duration`/`--part-ms`/`--window`, per
  `docs/CLI-STANDARD.md`.
- **Examples**: `serve_mock` (synthetic stream, no RTSP/network needed) and
  `serve_rtsp` (serves one real RTSP URL given on the command line).

### v1 scope
LL-HLS only (DASH/LL-DASH is v1.1); RTSP pull only (no SRT/TS/file ingest); no
per-viewer sessions/SSAI/manifest rewrites; no DVR/VOD/disk spill (RAM-only
rolling window); no TLS/auth (front it with a reverse proxy); no trick-play.
