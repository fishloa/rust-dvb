//! The shared origin-level resource route: `init-*.mp4` / `seg-*.m4s` /
//! `part-*.m4s` byte serving, mounted **once per stream** by
//! [`crate::origin::router`] rather than per-`Output` — LL-HLS and DASH are
//! both fMP4/CMAF and reference the exact same bytes (resolved through the
//! route's shared [`hls_runtime::server::HlsOrigin`], the `ServedEgress`
//! every output's bytes resolve through — see [`crate::http`]), so serving
//! them per-output would duplicate the route (and previously caused an axum
//! panic: two `Output`s both mounting a `/:file` catch-all under the same
//! `/{stream}` nest — issue #663 P4's "multi-output nest collision" fix).
//!
//! Each [`crate::output::Output`] contributes only its manifest route(s)
//! (`master.m3u8`/`media.m3u8` for LL-HLS, `manifest.mpd` for DASH); this
//! module is the one thing every output shares.
//!
//! # Chunked-transfer whole-segment serving (issue #721)
//!
//! [`crate::output::ll_dash`]'s true low-latency DASH design addresses whole
//! segments (`seg-{track}-{seq}.m4s`, the same filenames
//! [`crate::output::dash`]'s regular MPD uses) but needs a segment's bytes to
//! start flowing *before* it closes. [`dynamic_file`] implements this: a
//! `seg-*.m4s` request that doesn't (yet) resolve to a closed segment falls
//! through to [`stream_in_progress_segment`], which re-fetches that
//! segment's `part-{track}-{seq}.{idx}.m4s` entries in order — the exact
//! bytes the route's `HlsOrigin` already produces for LL-HLS's own
//! preload-hint requests — and streams them as one HTTP
//! chunked-transfer-encoded response body, ending once a part index resolves
//! [`media_plane::egress::EgressResponse::NotFound`] (which only happens once
//! the segment has actually closed without that part, i.e. exactly the
//! segment's end). A genuinely future segment (nothing produced yet) blocks
//! the same bounded [`crate::http::BLOCKING_RELOAD_TIMEOUT`] on its first
//! part before giving up (404), mirroring the plain closed-segment/part
//! lookups below. LL-HLS itself never triggers this path: its playlist never
//! advertises an in-progress segment's whole-segment URI (RFC 8216bis
//! §4.4.4.9), so a well-behaved client never requests one.
