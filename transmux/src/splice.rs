//! IR-level timeline splice / concatenation → server-side ad insertion (SSAI),
//! operating on the [`Media`] IR before muxing (issue #475).
//!
//! Where [`crate::rebase`] conditions a *single* timeline (rebase-to-zero,
//! offset, 33-bit wrap-unroll, gap insertion), this module *joins* two
//! [`Media`] timelines into one monotonic decode timeline:
//!
//! - [`concat`](fn@concat) — append `b` after `a` on a shared timeline: for each matched
//!   track, `b`'s samples follow `a`'s, with `b` rebased so its first sample's
//!   decode time equals `a`'s end decode time (contiguous, no gap or overlap).
//! - [`splice_insert`] — SSAI: play `base` up to a splice time, insert `ad`,
//!   then resume the remainder of `base` shifted forward by `ad`'s duration.
//!
//! # Timeline model (ISO/IEC 14496-12 `tfdt`)
//!
//! [`Sample`] timing is *absolute* (media plane step 2c): each sample carries
//! its own optional decode time (DTS) and presentation time (PTS =
//! DTS + composition_offset), in the track's media timescale.
//! [`Track::start_decode_time`] — which [`CmafMux`](crate::media::CmafMux)
//! writes as the *first* fragment's `tfdt` `baseMediaDecodeTime` (ISO/IEC
//! 14496-12:2015 §8.8.12) — is the track's start anchor, not a running cursor:
//! a source that re-seeds `tfdt` per fragment (a discontinuous or gapped
//! capture) can leave a real gap between it and a later sample's true `dts`.
//! This module therefore reads each join/snap boundary's absolute `dts`
//! directly rather than reconstructing it as `start_decode_time + Σ
//! durations`, falling back to that reconstruction only where a sample
//! genuinely carries no timestamp (a section-carried sample — SCTE-35/
//! DSM-CC/private sections — which has none to read). Coded sample bytes are
//! preserved byte-for-byte; only timing anchors/durations are recomputed.
//!
//! # Rebasing the spliced-in content (issue #782)
//!
//! Two independently-demuxed assets have unrelated absolute timelines (each
//! anchored on its own `tfdt`/PCR/FLV clock) — simply appending a second
//! [`Media`]'s samples after a join point, keeping their own file's absolute
//! `dts`/`pts`, produces an arbitrary jump instead of a contiguous join. So
//! [`concat`](fn@concat) and [`splice_insert`] shift every incoming sample's
//! `dts`/`pts` (when `Some`) by `join_dts - incoming_reference_start` before
//! placing it:
//!
//! - **One offset per splice, derived from a single reference track** — the
//!   video track if either side has one, else the first track that carries a
//!   real timestamp (`pick_reference_track`) — and applied uniformly to
//!   every matched track, converted into each track's own timescale
//!   (`rescale_ticks`). Deriving the shift independently per track instead
//!   would silently re-align tracks relative to each other and destroy A/V
//!   sync (a track's own boundary sample needn't correspond, wall-clock, to
//!   another track's).
//! - **Composition offsets survive exactly**: `dts` and `pts` shift by the
//!   same amount (`shift_samples`), so `pts - dts` is unchanged.
//! - **No accumulated rounding across repeated splices**: every splice call
//!   rescales the *fresh, already-materialized absolute* reference-track
//!   ticks (the join point and the incoming asset's own start) directly into
//!   each track's timescale — it never caches and re-rescales an
//!   already-rounded delta from a previous splice. A chain of splices reads
//!   real integers out of the previous call's result every time, so any
//!   sub-tick rounding from one splice can never compound into the next.
//! - **`dts: None` samples are left untouched** — a section-carried sample
//!   (SCTE-35/DSM-CC/private sections) has no timestamp to rebase and none is
//!   fabricated.
//!
//! The reference track's own contribution lands exactly on the join (no
//! rescale needed, same timescale); a non-reference track's contribution
//! lands within a fraction of a tick of the wall-clock join, preserving
//! whatever real inter-track relationship the incoming asset already had
//! (e.g. a small audio pre-roll ahead of video) rather than forcing every
//! track to butt exactly against its own predecessor.
//!
//! # Keyframe / RAP alignment
//!
//! A splice boundary must fall on a sync sample (random-access point) so the
//! spliced-in content — and the resumed base — can be decoded from the cut.
//! [`concat`](fn@concat) and [`splice_insert`] therefore require the inserted content's
//! first sample to be a sync sample ([`Error::InvalidInput`] otherwise). For
//! [`splice_insert`] the requested splice time is **snapped to the nearest
//! preceding sync sample** of the base's video track via [`snap_to_preceding_sync`]
//! (a helper, so the snap is independently testable); the snapped time is exposed
//! on the returned [`SplicePoint`]s.
//!
//! # Discontinuity signalling
//!
//! Each join is a media-timeline discontinuity (RFC 8216 §4.3.4.3). The result
//! is a [`SpliceResult`] carrying the [`Media`] plus the [`SplicePoint`]s (track
//! id + sample index + presentation time of each join), so a downstream HLS
//! packager / [`Segmenter`](crate::segmenter::Segmenter) can emit
//! `#EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY` before exactly those segments (drive the segmenter's
//! [`mark_discontinuity`](crate::segmenter::Segmenter::mark_discontinuity) at the
//! reported sample indices).
//!
//! # Follow-up
//!
//! Selecting splice *points* from SCTE-35 cue messages (parsing
//! `splice_info_section` `splice_time`/`break_duration` to decide *where* and how
//! long) is a follow-up — it would add a `scte35-splice` (+ `timed-metadata` for
//! PTS wrap handling) dependency. This module does the timeline mechanics for an
//! explicitly supplied time / point; a later transform can compute those points
//! from SCTE-35 and feed them here.

/// split — the video-timescale offset is rescaled into each other track's own
/// media timescale (audio is virtually never carried on the same timescale as
/// video, e.g. 90 kHz video vs. 44.1/48 kHz audio) before searching for its
/// split sample; audio is not independently RAP-aligned, but every audio sample
/// is itself a sync sample, so the audio cut is always on a RAP. The snapped
