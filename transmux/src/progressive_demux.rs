//! Progressive (single-file, non-fragmented) MP4 demux — ISO/IEC
//! 14496-12:2015 §8.5–§8.7.
//!
//! [`ProgressiveDemux`] parses a non-fragmented `.mp4` (a `moov` carrying full
//! per-track sample tables, no `moof`) into the crate's [`Media`] IR — the
//! demux counterpart to [`crate::progressive::ProgressiveMux`] and the
//! moov-only sibling of [`crate::media::Fmp4Demux`]. It reuses
//! [`crate::media`]'s `moov` → [`crate::pipeline::TrackSpec`] reconstruction
//! verbatim (the `stsd` → [`crate::pipeline::CodecConfig`] path is the single
//! shared implementation for both demuxers), and additionally walks the
//! `stbl` sample tables that a progressive file carries instead of
//! `moof`/`trun` fragments:
//!
//! - `stts` (§8.6.1.2): run-length decode-time deltas, expanded to a
//!   per-sample duration.
//! - `ctts` (§8.6.1.3): run-length composition offsets (v0 unsigned / v1
//!   signed — both stored as a wire `u32` reinterpreted as `i32`, matching
//!   [`crate::timing::CompositionOffsetBox`]'s own convention), expanded to a
//!   per-sample composition offset; absent ⇒ every sample's offset is `0`.
//! - `stss` (§8.6.2): the sync-sample index list; absent ⇒ every sample is a
//!   sync sample (§8.6.2).
//! - `stsz` (§8.7.3): per-sample sizes, either a uniform `sample_size` or an
//!   explicit per-sample list.
//! - `stsc` (§8.7.4) + `stco`/`co64` (§8.7.5): expanded into a per-chunk
//!   sample count, then walked chunk-by-chunk (each chunk offset is an
//!   *absolute* file byte offset per §8.7.5) to slice each sample's coded
//!   bytes directly out of the input — no separate `mdat` lookup is needed,
//!   because chunk offsets are already file-absolute.
//!
//! This demuxer never reads the `elst` edit list (ISO/IEC 14496-12:2015
//! §8.6.6): the [`Track`]/[`Sample`] IR the tracks are built into carries only
//! decode-order sample timing, matching every other demuxer in this crate — a
//! presentation-timeline edit remains a mux/consumer-side concern.
