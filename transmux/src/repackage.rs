//! fMP4/CMAF repackaging — IR transforms + a driver (ISO/IEC 14496-12; CMAF
//! ISO/IEC 23000-19).
//!
//! `transmux` is an any-to-any container hub: [`Fmp4Demux`]
//! parses fragmented ISOBMFF/CMAF into the neutral [`Media`] IR, and
//! [`Segmenter`] / [`CmafMux`](crate::media::CmafMux) mux the IR back into CMAF.
//! *Repackaging* composes those two ends with pure transforms on the IR in the
//! middle — no new box parsing:
//!
//! - **track-select** — [`Media::select_tracks`] keeps a chosen subset of tracks,
//!   preserving their source order and [`TrackSpec`]s.
//! - **trim** — [`Media::trim`] keeps only the samples whose *presentation time*
//!   (composition time = decode time + `composition_offset`) falls in the
//!   half-open window `[start, end)`, expressed in the **movie timescale**
//!   ([`Media::movie_timescale`]). The first kept video sample is guaranteed to
//!   be a sync sample: the window's lower edge is snapped **back** to the
//!   preceding random-access point on the segmentation anchor track (see
//!   [`Media::trim`] for the exact rule), so the output opens on a keyframe as
//!   CMAF requires (ISO/IEC 23000-19 §7.3.2.3: a CMAF Track's first media
//!   sample must be an IDR/SAP). Output decode times are re-based to zero: the
//!   IR carries only the retained samples and the muxers emit
//!   `base_media_decode_time = 0` for the first segment.
//! - **resegment** — feed the (optionally selected/trimmed) IR through
//!   [`Segmenter`] at a new target segment duration to produce fresh CMAF init +
//!   media segments cut on the anchor track's keyframes.
//!
//! [`Repackage`] is the convenience driver: it demuxes fMP4 bytes, applies an
//! optional track selection + trim window, and resegments at a target duration,
//! returning the CMAF init segment plus the media segments.
//!
//! `no_std` + `alloc`.
