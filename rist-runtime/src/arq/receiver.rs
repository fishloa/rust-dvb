//! ARQ receiver-side state — VSF TR-06-1:2020 §5.3.1 (Reorder Section +
//! Retransmission Reassembly Section, loss detection), §5.3.2
//! (retransmission-request formats), §5.3.4 (burst control). Retry-timing
//! specifics are librist-sourced, not spec-stated — see the `arq` module
//! doc's Attribution section before reading [`ArqConfig`] fields as if they
//! were transcribed numbers.
//!
//! Sans-IO: [`Receiver`] never reads a wall clock — [`Receiver::feed`] and
//! [`Receiver::tick`] take a caller-supplied `now: core::time::Duration`.
//!
//! # The two-stage buffer (§5.3.1)
//!
//! TR-06-1 describes packets crossing a Reorder Section before entering a
//! Retransmission Reassembly Section, with loss detected "at the boundary
//! between these two sections." This engine implements that as: an arriving
//! packet that is exactly the next expected sequence number is delivered
//! immediately (§5.3.1's own "minimum-delay" alternative — TR-06-1 names
//! this as a valid, if noisier, implementation choice); an arriving packet
//! *ahead* of the next expected number opens a gap, and every sequence
//! number in that gap starts aging in the Reorder Section from that moment.
//! [`Receiver::tick`] promotes a gap into the Retransmission Reassembly
//! Section — i.e. treats it as a confirmed, NACK-eligible loss — once it has
//! aged [`ArqConfig::reorder_section`] without the missing packet arriving.
//! This mapping (time-based promotion per gap, rather than a literal
//! per-packet dwell buffer every packet passes through) is this crate's own
//! reading of §5.3.1's informative description, not itself spec-cited.
